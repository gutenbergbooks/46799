<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Boys</span>:—</p>


<p>The time has at last arrived when we must
say good-bye to our pioneer friends, the Armstrongs.
You will remember how we have followed
their adventurous careers down the Ohio,
along the Mississippi, then up the great Missouri
to the wonder country of the Yellowstone; and
now, between the covers of the present volume,
are narrated the concluding incidents in the
story of “Westward Ho!”</p>

<p>Our country is deeply indebted to the class of
pioneers typified by the Armstrong boys. Restless
spirits many of them were, always yearning
for richer lands where game would be more
plentiful. It was undoubtedly this desire that
led them further and further into the “Country
of the Setting Sun,” constantly seeking that
which many of them never found; until at length
the Pacific barred their further progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob and Sandy Armstrong, together with
their sturdy sons, Dick and Roger, are but
types of the settlers who opened up the rich
territory of the Mississippi Valley, as well as
the Great West. Their kind is not so numerous
now, at least in our own country, since the need
for such adventurous souls has become less
acute. In many places, however, like the Canadian
Northwest, they can still be met with,
forging the links that will bind the wilderness
to civilization.</p>

<p>If you boys have found one half the enjoyment
in reading of the exploits of our young
pioneers that the task has afforded the author
in writing of them, his aim, which has been to
instruct as well as to entertain, will have been
accomplished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE LURE OF THE SETTING SUN</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> strikes me, Dick, the rapids are noisier
to-day than ever before.”</p>

<p>“We have time enough yet, Roger, to paddle
ashore, and give up our plan of running them.”</p>

<p>“But that would be too much like showing the
white feather, Cousin; and you must know that
we Armstrongs never like to do that.”</p>

<p>“Then we are to try our luck in the midst of
the snarling, white-capped water-wolves, are we,
Roger?”</p>

<p>“I say, ‘yes.’ We started to make the run,
and a little extra noise isn’t going to frighten us
off. Besides, we may not have another chance
to try it.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Roger, for I heard Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Lewis say we’d have to start up the river
again in a few days, heading into the great West,
the Land of the Setting Sun.”</p>

<p>“I am ready, Dick. My paddle can be depended
on to see us through. We’ll soon be at
the head of the rapids, too.”</p>

<p>“Already the canoe feels the pull, and races
to meet it. Steady now, Roger, and let us remember
what the Indians told us about the only
safe passage through the Big Trouble Water, as
they call it. A little more to the left—now
straight ahead, and both together!”</p>

<p>The two sturdy, well-grown lads who crouched
in the frail Indian craft, made of tanned buffalo
skins, need no introduction to those who have
read any of the preceding volumes of this series.</p>

<p>There may be those, however, who, in these
pages, are making the acquaintance of Dick and
Roger, the young pioneers, for the first time;
and for their benefit a little explanation may be
necessary.</p>

<p>While the pair are shooting downward, on the
rapidly increasing current of the Yellowstone
River, toward the roaring rapids, on this spring
day in the year 1805, let us take a brief look
backward. Who were these daring lads of the
old frontier days, and how came they so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
from the westernmost settlements of the English-speaking
race along the Mississippi, and
about the mouth of the Missouri?</p>

<p>Dick Armstrong and his cousin, Roger, were
the sons of two brothers whose adventures along
the Ohio in the days of Daniel Boone occupied
our attention in the earlier stories of border
life. They were worthy of their fathers, for
Dick had inherited the thoughtful character of
Bob Armstrong, while Roger at times displayed
the same bold disposition that had always
marked Sandy, his parent, in the perilous days
when they founded their homes in the then untrodden
wilderness.</p>

<p>The families were now located at that spot
which had first been taken up by the French, and
called St. Louis in honor of the King of France.
Their grandfather, David Armstrong, still lived,
as did also his wife, hale and hearty, enjoying
the increasing households of their children.</p>

<p>Bob and Sandy had both married, and besides
Dick there was a smaller son, named Sam in the
cabin of the former. Roger had a little sister,
called Mary, in honor of her grandmother.</p>

<p>The two cousins had grown up, as did most
lads of those early days, accustomed to think
for themselves, and to meet danger bravely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Both of them were accomplished in all the arts
known to successful woodsmen. They learned
from experience, as well as from the lips of old
borderers who visited in their homes, and were
able to hold their own with any boys of their age
in the community.</p>

<p>A sudden calamity threatened to disturb the
peace of the Armstrong circle, when it was
learned that there was a flaw in the deed by
which their property was held. An important
signature was required in order to perfect this
title, and, unless this could be obtained, and
shown by the succeeding spring, everything
would pass into the possession of a rich and unscrupulous
French Indian trader, François
Lascelles by name.</p>

<p>Inquiry developed the fact that Jasper Williams,
the man whose signature was so important
to the happiness of all the Armstrongs, had
gone with the expedition undertaken by Captain
Lewis and Captain Clark, which was headed into
the unknown country of the Setting Sun, with
the hope of finding a way to the far distant Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p>No white man had as yet crossed the vast
stretches of country that lay west of the rolling
Mississippi, and it was the boldest undertaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
ever known when President Jefferson influenced
Congress to stand back of his proposition to
learn the extent of the possessions that had recently
come to the United States. (<a id="Note_1r"></a><a href="#Note_1">Note 1</a>.)<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The President’s private secretary, Captain
Lewis, headed the small party of adventurous
spirits, assisted by an army officer, Captain
Clark. They left St. Louis in the spring of
1804, and had been long on the way when the
Armstrongs discovered that the one man whom
they could depend on to save their homes was
with the expedition.</p>

<p>Ordinarily Bob and Sandy Armstrong would
have been quick to take upon themselves the
duty of overtaking the expedition, and securing
the necessary signature; but a recent injury prevented
one of the brothers from going.</p>

<p>In the end the proposition of Dick and Roger
to undertake the stupendous task was agreed
to, and the boys started, mounted on two horses
and equipped as well as the times permitted.
The adventures they met with were thrilling in
the extreme, and have been described at length
in earlier volumes.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The youths overtook the expedition after it
had gone far up the “Great Muddy,” as the
Missouri had already become known, and the
coveted signature was obtained. Then the lads
were tempted to continue with the party, since
Captain Lewis was sending back one of his most
trusted scouts with an account of what had already
happened to the expedition, for the perusal
of President Jefferson; and he could be
trusted to see that the precious document
reached the Armstrongs.</p>

<p>During the winter just passed the two boys
were kept busy in the rôle of scouts and providers
of fresh meat for the camp, a duty which
their early training made them peculiarly fitted
to assume.</p>

<p>The expedition had laid out a comfortable
camp near the Indian village of the Mandan
tribe, with whom peaceful relations had
been established at the time of their first arrival
in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Some of the bolder spirits had ventured into
the realm of natural wonders now known as Yellowstone
Park, and had viewed with amazement
and awe the strange geysers that spouted hot
water hundreds of feet in the air at stated periods,
as well as many other singular mysteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick and Roger had been among the fortunate
few to view these marvels; but, as a rule, the
soldiers and bordermen associated with the two
captains were almost as superstitious as the ignorant
red men, and actually feared to set eyes
on these strange freaks of Nature which they
could not understand. The Indians called the
place the Bad Lands, and believed an evil Manitou
dwelt there, who was ever ready to seize
upon and enchain those reckless warriors who
should invade his territory.</p>

<p>Slowly the long winter had passed away, and
all seemed to be going well. There had been occasional
signs of trouble, when hostile hunting
parties of Indians were encountered; but, thus
far, none of the expedition had been more than
wounded in these frays.</p>

<p>Spring was at last at hand, and every one
in the party looked forward with eagerness
to the fresh start that was soon to be made.
They had gathered much information concerning
the vast stretch of plains and mountains
that still lay between them and their goal; but,
since only Indians had ever penetrated that
wilderness, these stories were invariably untrustworthy,
for the mind of the red man
was very much like that of a child, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
see things only from an imaginative standpoint.</p>

<p>About all that the adventurers really knew
was that there was a tremendous barrier of
mountains which they must climb before they
could hope to attain their ambitious aim and
gaze upon the Pacific Ocean, seen at that time
only by those, following Balboa, who had
crossed the narrow isthmus where the Panama
Canal now joins the rival oceans.</p>

<p>Every evening, when the sun was setting in
a maze of glowing colors, Dick and Roger were
accustomed to stand and watch until the last
fiery finger had finally faded from the skies. To
them that mysterious West held out beckoning
arms. They never tired of talking about the
fresh wonders they might gaze upon once they
started into the trackless wilds; and their young
souls were aflame with eagerness as the days
crept along, each one bringing them closer to
the hour of departure.</p>

<p>For some time they had intended to take a
canoe through the big rapids of the river, which
they had passed in ascending the stream, before
making the winter camp. From the Indians
they had secured all possible information, and
finally, knowing that their time here was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
short, they had set forth with the canoe that
had been their property for months, bent upon
undertaking the rather risky voyage.</p>

<p>If the daring canoe-man knows his course, the
passing through a rapid, amidst all the foam
and rush of hungry waters, is not the perilous
thing it seems. Besides a knowledge of the
way, all that is required is a bold heart, a quick
eye, a stout paddle, and muscular arms to
wield it.</p>

<p>The two lads soon entered the upper stretches
of the white-capped water. They quickly
picked out their course, and found themselves
shooting downward with almost incredible
speed. Around them on every hand was boiling,
tumultuous water, curling and rushing and
leaping as though eager to seize upon its prey.</p>

<p>Dick and his cousin were not at all dismayed.
They had rubbed up against perils so often in
their young lives that they could keep cool in
the face of almost any danger. Roger crouched
in the bow and fended off from the rocks, so that
the glancing blows the boat received would not
damage the tough skins of which the craft was
made.</p>

<p>Dick occupied the stern, and his was the crafty
hand that really guided the canoe, for Roger always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
acknowledged that his cousin could handle
a paddle better than he could.</p>

<p>They had passed more than two-thirds of the
way down the rapids, and the worst seemed to
be behind them, when something strange happened.</p>

<p>The canoe struck a partly submerged, but perfectly
smooth, rock. It was only a slight blow,
and glancing at that, but nevertheless the results
were startling. No sooner had the accident occurred
than the bottom of the boat gaped open
and the water rushed in with terrible speed.
One look convinced Dick that it was quite hopeless
to try to keep the craft afloat with their
weight to force this flood through the hole.</p>

<p>“Quick! snatch up your gun, and jump overboard,
Roger!” he shouted. “And hold on to
the boat, remember, like grim death!”</p>

<p>Roger was nothing if not catlike in his actions
when an emergency arose; and the two lads
leaped over into the swirling water as one, ready
to battle for their lives with the rapids, where
the superstitious red men said the evil spirits
dwelt amidst continual strife and warring.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>WRECKED IN THE RAPIDS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> they made this sudden plunge, the two
boys were careful to maintain their grip upon
the sides of the boat, one being on the right and
the other on the left. Relieved of their weight,
the buoyant canoe would probably float, and
might yet prove of considerable help to them in
navigating the remainder of the boisterous rapids.</p>

<p>All pioneer boys early learned to swim like
fishes. It was as much a part of their education
as handling a gun, or acquiring a knowledge
of woodcraft. The lad who was not proficient
in all these things would have been hard to find,
and had he been discovered, the chances were
he would have been deemed a true mollycoddle,
and fit only to wear the dresses of his sister, or,
as the Indians would have described it, be a
“squaw.”</p>

<p>No sooner had Dick and Roger found themselves
in the swift flowing waters than they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
struck out most manfully to keep themselves
and the boat afloat. It was no new experience in
their adventurous career, for before now they
had more than once found themselves battling
with a flood.</p>

<p>For a brief time it promised to be a most exciting
experience, and one that would require
their best endeavors if they hoped to come out
alive at the foot of the rapids. To be hurled
against some of the jutting spurs of rock with
all the force of that speeding current would
mean blows that would weaken their powers of
resistance, and cause them to lose their grip on
the side of the canoe.</p>

<p>There were times when they were almost overwhelmed
by the dashing, foamy waters. In
every instance, however, their pluck and good
judgment served to carry them through the difficulty.</p>

<p>All the while they had the satisfaction of
knowing that they must be drawing closer to the
end of the rapids. Already Dick believed he
could notice a little slackening of the fury with
which they were beaten on all sides by the lashing
waters. He managed to give a shout to encourage
his cousin.</p>

<p>“Keep holding on, Roger; we are nearly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the bottom! Another minute will take us into
smoother water! Tighten your grip, and we
shall win out yet!”</p>

<p>“I’m game to the finish!” was all Roger could
say in reply, for every time he opened his mouth
it seemed as though some of the riotous water
would swoop over his head and almost choke him
by forcing itself down his throat.</p>

<p>Before another minute was half over they had
come to the foot of the rapids, and, still holding
to the waterlogged canoe, floated out upon comparatively
smooth water. Here amidst the
foam and eddies they managed to push the boat
toward the shore.</p>

<p>Roger was already laughing, a little hysterically
it is true, for he had been tremendously
worked up over the exciting affair. It might
have ended in a tragedy for them; but, now that
the peril was past, Roger could afford to act as
if he saw only the humorous side of the accident.</p>

<p>“That was a very close call, Dick!” he ventured,
as they continued to swim as best they
could, holding their guns in the hands that at
the same time clutched the gunwales of the boat.</p>

<p>“We rather expected it,” replied Dick, “and
laid our plans to meet an upset; but it came with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a rush, after all. Who’d ever believe such a
little knock against a rock would have burst the
tough skin of our hide boat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a perfectly <i>smooth</i> rock at that,”
added Roger, as though he knew this to a certainty,
and it added to the mystery in his eyes.
“I believed these boats were tough enough to
stand ten times that amount of pounding. I believe
after all I prefer our old style of dugout.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they may be clumsy, but you can depend
on them all the time; and after this I think
I’ll be suspicious about a hide boat,” Dick continued.</p>

<p>The shore was now close at hand, and they
found little difficulty in making a landing. At
the same time the half sunken Indian boat was
dragged up on the bank, and tipped over to relieve
it of the water, though that began to pour
out through the rent in the bottom as soon as it
left the river.</p>

<p>It was only natural that the two boys should
first throw themselves down on the soft bank to
regain some of their breath after such an exciting
time. Then, having been brought up in the
school of preparedness, their next act was to
examine their guns, and to renew the priming
of powder in the pan, so that the weapons, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which, they always depended to defend themselves
against sudden perils, would be in condition
for immediate use in case of necessity.</p>

<p>In those days old heads were to be found on
young shoulders. Responsibility caused lads,
hardly entering their teens, to become the defenders
of their families, as well as hunters and
trappers. And the Armstrong cousins had long
filled a position of trust of this description in
the home circles.</p>

<p>“Well, we shot the rapids, all right,” remarked
Roger, presently, with a whimsical
smile; “but not exactly as we had planned.
Now we can have the pleasure of walking back
to camp. At least it saves us the bother of paddling
all the way, after making a carry around
the rapids. And we meant to give our boat to
one of the Mandan boys, you remember, Dick.”</p>

<p>“I’m puzzled about that boat,” remarked the
other, frowning.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean you wonder what
made it play such a treacherous trick on us,
after standing the wear and tear of the winter,”
Roger observed.</p>

<p>“Yes, for you remember we examined it
closely only yesterday, and made sure it was in
perfect condition. Suppose we take a look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that break, and see how it happened to come.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the chances are,” said Roger, carelessly,
“the old hide became worn or weak through age,
and gave way. Still,” he added, “that was
only a little bump, Dick, and I’m as bothered as
you are how to explain it.”</p>

<p>In another minute they were bending over the
upturned canoe. Immediately both boys uttered
exclamations of astonishment, as though
they had made a discovery that gave them an
unexpected thrill.</p>

<p>“Why, it looks as if a sharp knife blade had
been drawn straight down along here, and cut
nearly through the skin, so that even a little
blow would finish it!” exclaimed Roger, turning
his troubled eyes upon his cousin as if to ascertain
whether the other agreed with him.</p>

<p>“That is exactly what has been done,” added
Dick, soberly. “See, you can even notice where
the slit extends further than the break. This
was not as much an accident as we thought,
Roger. Some rascal, who knew what we expected
to do, tried to bring about our destruction
in the rapids!”</p>

<p>“But it must have been done since yesterday,”
declared the other angrily, “for we
looked over every inch of the skin of the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
then, and surely would have noticed the deep
scoring of a knife blade.”</p>

<p>“There can be no doubt about that,” agreed
Dick. “And the work was skillfully done in
the bargain. Whoever made that cut expected
that the boat would strike against rocks many
times during the run of the rapids, and took
chances that one of the blows would tear open
the weak place. And that is what happened.”</p>

<p>“It would have gone much harder with us if
we had not been most of the way down the descent,”
said Roger, with a frown on his face.
“But, Dick, who could the treacherous rascal
be? As far as we know, we have not made a
single enemy among the members of the party.
Would one of our Indian friends have played
such a mean trick on us, do you think?”</p>

<p>“No one but an enemy could have done it,
Roger, because there was nothing to gain; for
while some Indians might envy us our rifles
these would surely be lost with us in the rapids
and never recovered.”</p>

<p>“That makes the mystery worse than ever,
then,” fretted the other lad, who was so constituted
that among his boy friends down along
the Missouri he had often gone under the name
of “Headstrong Roger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have a suspicion, although there is really
nothing to back it up, that I can see,” remarked
Dick, reflectively, as though at some time in the
past winter he had allowed himself to speculate
concerning certain things which were now again
taking possession of his mind.</p>

<p>“Dick, tell me what it is about, please,” urged
his cousin, “because I’m groping in the dark,
myself.”</p>

<p>“There is only one man that I know of who
hates us bitterly,” commenced Dick, and instantly
a flash of intelligence overspread the
face of the other.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that French trader, François
Lascelles?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of him, and his equally unscrupulous
son, Alexis,” Dick admitted.</p>

<p>“But, when we captured them last fall, they
were held prisoners in the camp until Mayhew,
the scout, was well on his way down the river
and could not possibly be overtaken. Then the
party of Frenchmen was let go, with the solemn
warning from Captain Lewis that if any of them
loitered around this region they would be shot
on sight. And Dick, all winter long you remember
we have seen nothing of Lascelles, or indeed
for that matter any other white man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Still,” urged the other, “he may have come
back here again when he found he could not overtake
Mayhew and secure that paper. A man
like François Lascelles hates bitterly, and never
forgives. To be beaten in his game by a
couple of mere boys would make him gnash his
teeth every time he remembered it. Yes, something
seems to tell me, Roger, that our old enemy
has returned, and is even now in communication
with some treacherous member of the expedition.”</p>

<p>“You mean his money has hired some one to
play this terrible trick that might have cost us
our lives; is that it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“It is only a guess with me,” replied the
other, soberly; “but I can see no other explanation
of this mystery.”</p>

<p>“But who could be the guilty man in the
camp?” asked Roger. “We believed every one
was our friend, from the two captains down to
the lowest in line. It is terrible to suspect
any one of a crime like this. How will we
ever be able to find out about it, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“We must begin to keep our eyes about us
and watch,” advised Dick. “One by one we
can cross the names off our list until it narrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
down to two or three. Sooner or later we shall
find out the truth.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell Captain Lewis about the
knife-slit along the bottom of our boat?” demanded
Roger.</p>

<p>“It is our duty to tell him,” Dick declared.
“The man who could stoop to such a trick as
that, just for love of money, is not fit to stay in
the ranks of honest explorers. Once we can
show him the proof, I am sure Captain Lewis
will kick the rascal out of camp. But I can see
that you are beginning to shiver, Roger; so the
first thing we ought to do now is to make a fire,
and dry our clothes as best we may.”</p>

<p>“I was just going to say that myself, Dick, because
this spring air is sharp, with little heat in
the sun. To tell you the honest truth my teeth
are beginning to rattle like those bones the Mandan
medicine man shakes, when he dances to
frighten off the evil spirit that has entered the
body of a sick man. So let’s gather some wood
and make a blaze.”</p>

<p>With that, both boys began to bestir themselves,
first of all slapping their arms back and
forth to induce circulation; after which they
started to collect dry wood in a heap. At no
time, however, did they let their precious guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
leave their possession, for they knew that when
fire-arms were needed it was usually in a hurry,
and to save life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>WOLVES IN THE TIMBER</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Let</span> me light the pile, Dick,” Roger pleaded,
after they had made sufficient preparation.</p>

<p>They had selected only dry wood for various
reasons. In the first place, this would burn
more readily, and thus throw off the heat they
wanted in order to dry their clothes. At the
same time it was likely to make little smoke that
could be seen by the eyes of any hostile Indians
who might be within a mile or so of the spot.</p>

<p>Boys who lived in those pioneer days always
carried flint and steel along with them, in order
to kindle a blaze when necessary. Had these
been lacking, Roger, no doubt, would have been
equal to the occasion, for he could have flashed
some powder in the pan of his gun, and thus accomplished
his purpose. (<a id="Note_2r"></a><a href="#Note_2">Note 2</a>.)</p>

<p>In a short time Roger, being expert in these
lines, succeeded, by the use of flint and steel, as
well as some fine tinder, which he always carried
along with him in his ditty bag, in starting a
fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The wood blazed up and sent out a most gratifying
heat, so that both boys, by standing as
close as they could bear it, began to steam, very
much after the manner of some of the warm geysers,
during the stated periods when they were
not spouting, that the lads had looked upon in
the Land of Wonders.</p>

<p>“What shall we do about the boat?” asked
Roger, when they found that they were by degrees
getting dry, though it took a long time to
accomplish this desired end.</p>

<p>“I was thinking about that,” his cousin told
him. “It is not worth while for us to try to
patch the hole, because we expect to abandon it
very soon. Captain Lewis asked us to be with
him in his boat. We had better leave it here,
and perhaps they may send a couple of Indians
down to fetch it to camp.”</p>

<p>“You mean, Dick, if the captain wishes to see
for himself the mark of the treacherous knife
blade?”</p>

<p>“Which I think he will want to do, so as to
settle it in his own mind,” returned the other.
“This is, after all, the most terrifying thing that
has as yet happened to us on our long journey up
here into the heart of the wilderness.”</p>

<p>“That is just it, Dick. Open foes I can stand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
because you know what to expect; but it gives me
a creep to think of some unknown person standing
ready to stab us in the dark, or when our
backs are turned. Perhaps, after all, we did
wrong to decide on staying with Captain Lewis
and Captain Clark, when we might have gone on
home with Mayhew, carrying that precious
paper.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I wouldn’t look at it that way, Roger,”
said the other, striving to cheer him up, for
Roger was subject to sudden fits of depression.
“Just think of all the wonderful things we have
seen while here; and then remember that there
are still other strange sights awaiting us in the
Land of the Setting Sun.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so, Dick, and both of us decided
that the chance to look upon the great ocean was
one not to be lightly cast aside.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been lucky so far,” Dick told his
chum, “and succeeded in everything we have undertaken;
so even this new trouble mustn’t upset
us. By keeping a sharp lookout we can expect
to learn who the traitor is, and after that he
will be forced to leave the party. And if that
Lascelles is around here again he will have to
look out for himself. Anyhow,” he added
after a pause, “we have gone too far now to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
back, no matter whether we made a mistake or
not.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and as my father used to say,” continued
Roger, “‘what can’t be cured must be endured.’
We have made our bed, and must lie in
it, no matter how hard it may seem. I’m going
to believe just as you do, Dick—that the same
kind fate that has always watched over us in
times past is still on duty.”</p>

<p>He glanced upward toward the blue sky as he
said this, and Dick knew what he intended to imply;
for boys in those days were reared in a religious
atmosphere in their humble homes, and
early learned to “trust in the Lord; but keep
their powder dry,” as the Puritan Fathers used
to do.</p>

<p>“Our fathers often had to meet situations just
as dangerous as any that can come to us,” continued
Dick, “and they grappled them boldly
and came off victorious. So, from now on, we’ll
devote ourselves to finding out whose was the
unseen hand that held the knife with which our
hide boat was slashed so cleverly.”</p>

<p>“How far are we from camp, do you think,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“As the crow flies it may be five miles, though
we came further than that on the river,” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
other boy replied without any hesitation, showing
how completely he kept all these things in his
mind, to be utilized on short notice.</p>

<p>“We came down with a swift current,” Roger
admitted, “and it hardly seemed as if we could
have been an hour on the way. It will take
us some time to tramp back to camp, even if
we take a short-cut to avoid the bends in the
river.”</p>

<p>“What of that,” asked Dick, “since we expected
to spend a good part of the day in paddling
up the stream, after shooting the rapids?
But, if you are dry enough now, I think we had
better make a start.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we drag the boat into these bushes
first, Dick,” suggested Roger.</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea either, for some passing Indian
might think it worth while to mend the hole
and carry the boat off. We would like to have
Captain Lewis take a look at that knife mark,
so as to prove our story. He trusts all his men,
and it is going to make him feel badly to know
that one among them has sold himself to an
enemy.”</p>

<p>Between them they carried the hide canoe in
among the bushes, where it was easily hidden
away. Of course any one seeking it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
readily find its hiding-place; but at least it could
not be seen by the ordinary passer-by.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this, the two lads set
forth to cover the ground lying between their
landing place on the shore of the river, below the
rapids, and the camp of the explorers.</p>

<p>They anticipated no trouble in finding their
goal, because of their familiarity with woods life.
Besides, in their numerous hunting trips during
the past winter they had covered nearly all the
territory around that region, so that the chances
of their getting lost were small indeed.</p>

<p>“We may run across game on the way back,
don’t you think, Dick?” suggested Roger, just
after they had left the ashes of their late fire,
which had been dashed with water before they
quitted the scene.</p>

<p>“You never can tell,” came the reply; “there
is always a chance to sight a deer in this country.
We got a number, you remember, within
three miles of camp while the snow was deep on
the ground. And already I have noticed signs
telling that they use this section for feeding on
the early shoots of grass.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, “tracks there have been
in plenty. And as I live! see here, where this
tuft of reddish hair has caught on a pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
piece of bark. I warrant you some buck rubbed
himself against this tree good and hard. I
would like to have been within gunshot of the
rascal just then, for the marks are fresh, and I
think they were made this very morning.”</p>

<p>This gave the two boys hope that they might
at any minute run across the deer and bring him
down with a lucky shot. As fresh venison was
always welcome in the camp, such a possibility
as this always spurred them on to do their best.
They liked to hear the cheery voice of Captain
Lewis telling them frankly that it had been a
fortunate thing for the whole expedition when
he tempted Dick and Roger to remain and see
the enterprise through.</p>

<p>“Listen! what is all that noise ahead of us?”
asked Roger, as a sudden burst of snarling and
half-suppressed howling was borne to their
ears.</p>

<p>“Wolves, as sure as you live!” exclaimed
Dick, frowning, for if there was one animal upon
which he disliked to waste any of his precious
ammunition, that beast was a wolf.</p>

<p>Ordinarily these animals are not to be feared
when met singly, or even in pairs; but, during
the winter and early spring, they gather in
packs, in order to hunt the better for food, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
at such times even the boldest hunter dislikes
running across them.</p>

<p>“They are certainly on the track of something,”
suggested Roger, as he listened, and
then, shrugging his broad shoulders, he continued.
“Like as not, it is that buck we were
hoping to run across. A plague on the pests!
If I had my way, and could spare the ammunition,
I’d shoot every one of the lot!”</p>

<p>“Little good that would do,” Dick told him;
“because they run to thousands upon thousands
out on the plains and in the mountains where we
are heading. A dozen or two would be no more
than a grain of sand on that seashore we hope
to set eyes on before snow flies again.”</p>

<p>“But listen to them carrying on, Dick,” continued
the other, with growing excitement.
“Come to think of it, I never heard wolves make
those queer sounds when chasing a deer. You
know they yap like dogs, and almost bark.
These beasts are acting like those creatures did
when they had me caught up in a tree, with my
gun on the ground.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember the time well enough,”
chuckled Dick. “You were mighty glad to see a
fellow of my heft, too, when I came along.
Twenty hours up a tree is no joke, when you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
got a healthy appetite in the bargain. But, just
as you say, Roger, there is something queer
about the way they are carrying on.”</p>

<p>“They’re not chasing anything now, that’s
certain,” asserted the other positively; “because
the sounds keep coming from the same
place all the time. Dick, perhaps the beasts
may have some one treed for all we know. They
are savage with hunger, and would just as soon
make a meal off a hunter, red or white, as off a
deer or a wounded buffalo.”</p>

<p>“It happens to be right on our way to camp,”
remarked Dick, tightening his grip on his long-barreled
rifle, “so we can find out what’s up
without going far out of our path.”</p>

<p>This, of course, pleased Headstrong Roger,
always in readiness for adventure, it mattered
little of what nature. He always maintained
that he had a long-standing debt against the
tribe of <i>lupus</i> on account of that terrible fast
mentioned by his cousin, and, although powder
and ball were not too plentiful, he seldom failed
to take a shot at his four-footed enemies when
the chance came to him.</p>

<p>So now he fancied that he would end the
prowling of at least one red-tongued woods
rover. Certainly he could spare a single charge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and it would give him more satisfaction than almost
anything else. You see, Roger had rubbed
the old sore when he spoke of that bitter experience
in the past, and it smarted again venomously.</p>

<p>As they pushed steadily on, the sounds increased
in volume. They could even hear the
thud of heavy bodies falling back to the ground
after frantic leaps aloft, as though endeavoring
to reach some tempting object among the
branches of a tree.</p>

<p>Then Roger, who had the keenest eyesight of
the pair, muttered:</p>

<p>“There, I can just begin to see them through
the trees and brush yonder, Dick; and, as we believed,
they have some human being treed, or
else are trying to force conclusions with a
panther, which would be a strange thing, to be
sure.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” the other whispered,
“for it’s only a little way. Yes, I can see them
jumping up, just as you say. Roger, fasten
your eyes on the tree above, and tell me what
that dark object is.”</p>

<p>A minute later, as they still kept pushing forward,
Roger uttered a low cry.</p>

<p>“Well, after all, it’s an Indian brave up there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
And he’s already shot a number of the brutes
with his arrows; but I reckon his stock has given
out. He tries to strike them as they jump at
him, using his knife. And, Dick, I can see now
that he isn’t a Mandan Indian at all, but more
likely one of those Sioux who, under their sub-chief,
Beaver Tail, did us such a good turn last
fall, when we saved Jasper Williams from the
French traders. But what can a Sioux warrior
be doing here, in the land of his foes, the Mandans?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE BIRCH BARK MESSAGE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span>, I could see him reach down then and
strike at a leaping wolf!” exclaimed Dick, showing
signs of excitement, something he seldom
did, since he had wonderful control over his emotions
for a boy of his age.</p>

<p>“Just as I told you,” continued Roger, trembling
all over with eagerness, “he has used up
his arrows, and is trying to cut down the number
of his four-footed enemies by other means.”</p>

<p>“There, listen to that howl!”</p>

<p>“Oh! he made a splendid strike that time,
Dick!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you can see what that clever brave
is up to, if you notice the wild scuffle at the foot
of the tree,” the other replied.</p>

<p>“Why, the wolves seem to be fighting among
themselves, Dick. What makes them act that
way, do you know?”</p>

<p>“I can give a guess. These mad animals are
almost starving, though just how that should be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
at this season of the year, I am not able to say.
The scent of blood makes them wild, you see,
and, every time the brave’s knife wounds one of
the pack, the rest set upon the wretched beast to
finish him.”</p>

<p>“In that way the Indian could clean them up
in time, I should say, without any help from us,”
Roger suggested, though he showed no sign that
his intention of giving aid had changed in the
least.</p>

<p>“But they might take warning, and stop
jumping up at him,” Dick explained; “then his
knife would be useless. And, too, other wolves
hearing the noise are apt to hasten to the spot,
so that there might be an increasing pack, a new
one for every beast he helped to kill.”</p>

<p>“Dick, he is a brave fellow, even if his skin is
red!”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there,” said the other,
softly.</p>

<p>“Then are we not going to bring about
his rescue, even if it does cost us some of
our precious powder and shot?” Roger demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I hope it will not be more than one
load,” replied his cousin; for all their lives this
question of a wastage of ammunition had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
impressed on their minds as the utmost folly,
and on that account they seldom used their guns
except to make sure of worthy game.</p>

<p>“Come, let us rush forward with loud yells,
waving our arms, and doing everything we can
to scare the animals off before we begin to fire.
After we get close up, and they are hesitating
what to do, that is the time for us to blaze
away.”</p>

<p>“A good plan, Roger, and worthy of our
fathers’ old friend, Pat O’Mara. Only as a last
resort will we use our fire-arms.”</p>

<p>“And you be the one to say when, Dick, remember!”</p>

<p>“Depend on me for that,” Roger was told
quickly. “Just as soon as I see that something
is needed to force the ugly beasts to make up
their minds, I’ll call out to you to give it to
them.”</p>

<p>“Give me one last word of advice before we
rush them, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it, Roger?”</p>

<p>“If, instead of taking to their heels, the pack
turns on us, and starts to fight, what must we
do?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t one chance in ten it will happen
that way,” said Dick, “for wolves are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
cowardly. When they see us rushing boldly
forward you’ll notice how every beast’s head
will droop, and that he’ll begin to skulk away,
showing his teeth, perhaps, but cowed and
whipped.”</p>

<p>“But suppose it should?” urged Roger, as
they paused, just before bursting out upon the
strange scene.</p>

<p>“If it comes to the worst we may have to take
to a tree just as the Indian brave has done,”
Dick told him, “and then start to work killing
them off as fast as we can load and fire. Now,
are you ready to do a lot of yelling?”</p>

<p>“Just try me, that’s all, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Come on, then, with me!”</p>

<p>With the words Dick sprang boldly forth from
his concealment, with his cousin alongside.
Both of them started to make the woods ring
with their strong young voices, and when two
healthy boys yell and whoop they can produce
a tremendous volume of sound!</p>

<p>Some of those predatory wolves must have
conceived the idea that a whole company of the
strange two-legged foes was rushing toward
them, judging from the hasty manner of their
exit from the scene. Others, however, either
more bold or hungry, half crouched and, snarling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
showed their white teeth in a vicious manner.</p>

<p>Evidently these leaders of the pack were not
as yet quite convinced that the game had gone
against them, despite all the noise made by the
oncoming boys. On seeing this, Dick and Roger
tried to shout louder than ever, while they waved
their arms in the most frantic manner.</p>

<p>It devolved upon Dick to decide whether or
not they should keep on in this fashion until they
came to close quarters with the wolves that lingered,
loth to give up their chance of a dinner.
Rushing forward at this rate, they would be on
the scene in half a dozen seconds, and might find
the ugly beasts springing up at their throats.</p>

<p>Never before had the boys seen wolves acting
in this manner, for as a rule their nature is cowardly.
There was nothing for it but to fall back
upon their guns for the finishing stroke, and so
Dick gave the word.</p>

<p>“We must shoot, Roger—take that big fellow
in front!” he gasped, for he was by this time
fairly out of breath after all those strenuous exertions
of running, thrashing his arms, and
shouting at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Accordingly both of them halted just long
enough to throw their long-barreled rifles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
their shoulders, and glance along the sights.
They could actually hear the savage snarls of
the defiant pack. Roger, always a bit faster
than his companion, was the first to fire, and
with the crash of his gun the big leader of the
pack sprang upward, only to fall back again with
his legs kicking.</p>

<p>Dick’s gun spoke fast on the heels of the first
report, and he, too, succeeded in knocking over
the beast his quick eye had selected.</p>

<p>Then with renewed shouts, Dick and Roger
once more started forward, but there was a
hasty scurrying of gray bodies, and presently
not a wolf remained in sight save the pair that
had gone down before the deadly fire of the
guns.</p>

<p>The Indian up in the tree dropped to the
ground, and the boys saw immediately from his
manner of dress that he was, just as Roger had
surmised, a Sioux warrior. From the fact that
he was bleeding in various places the boys understood
that he must have put up a valiant fight at
close quarters against his four-footed enemies,
before finally seeking refuge among the branches
of the friendly tree.</p>

<p>Naturally both lads immediately began to
wonder why a Sioux brave should thus venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
into the neighborhood of the Mandan village,
since the two tribes had been at knives’ points
for many years. Indeed, the preceding fall,
when the boys had been aided by Beaver Tail
and some of his Sioux warriors, who accompanied
them later to their camp, it had required
all the tact and diplomacy of which Captain
Lewis was capable to prevent an open rupture
between the old-time rivals.</p>

<p>“First we must make him let us look at his
wounds,” suggested Dick, “because it is no
child’s play to have the teeth of wolves draw
blood. Some of his wounds look bad to me.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right, Dick,” agreed the
other, always accustomed to leaving the decision
to his cousin. “See if you can make him understand
what we want to do. I’ll get some water
in my hat, so you can wash the wounds.”</p>

<p>The boys always made it a practice to carry
certain homely remedies with them, for in those
pioneer days the family medicine chest consisted
in the main of dried herbs, and lotions made
from them, all put up by the wise housewife.
Those who lived this simple life, and were most
of the time in the open air, seldom found themselves
in need of a doctor, and most of their
troubles sprang either from accidents, or injuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
received in combats with wild beasts of
the forest.</p>

<p>So it was that they had with them a salve they
always used to soothe the pain, as well as
neutralize the poison injected by bites or
scratches received in struggles at close quarters
with carnivorous beasts.</p>

<p>The Indian was looking at them as though
puzzled. Whites were rarely seen by the dwellers
in these far regions beyond the Mississippi;
indeed, most of the natives had never as yet set
eyes on a paleface.</p>

<p>This brave, however, may have been in company
with Beaver Tail, the friendly chief, at the
time he aided the two boys, and, if so, he undoubtedly
recognized Dick and Roger.</p>

<p>Unable to speak the Sioux tongue, of which
they knew but a few words, it would be necessary
for Dick to make use of gestures in conducting
a brief conversation with the other. Still,
the smile on his face, as well as the fact of his
recent acts, would readily tell the red wanderer
that he was a friend.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” was all the Indian could say,
but he accepted the hand that was extended,
though possibly this method of greeting was
strange to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick pressed him to sit down, and the brave
did so, though with increasing wonder. He
speedily realized, however, what the white boys
meant to do, and without offering any remonstrance
continued silently to watch their labor,
as they proceeded to look after his injuries.</p>

<p>Roger fetched his hat full of cool water from
a running brook close by, and one by one Dick
washed the numerous scratches and ugly furrows
where those wolfish fangs had torn the flesh
of the stoical brave’s lower limbs.</p>

<p>He gave no sign of flinching, though the pain
must have been more than a trifle. The boys
knew enough of Indian character to feel sure
that, if it had been ten times as severe, he would
have calmly endured it, otherwise he could not
have claimed the right to wear the feather they
could see in his scalplock, and which signified
that he was a warrior, or brave.</p>

<p>Finally the task was completed. There had
been nothing further heard from the remnant of
the baffled wolf pack all this while, proving that
the loss of their powerful leaders must have
taken the last bit of courage from the animals,
known never to be very brave.</p>

<p>All the while the Sioux continued to keep those
black eyes of his glued on Dick Armstrong. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was as though he was in search of some one and
had made up his mind that, since there could be
no other paleface boys within a thousand miles
of the spot, these must be the ones he had been
commissioned to find.</p>

<p>Just about the time Dick, with another of his
rare smiles, indicated that the work of looking
after his injuries had been completed, the Sioux
fumbled in his snake-skin ditty bag, where he
kept his little stock of pemmican, and numerous
other necessary articles, perhaps his war paint
as well. To the astonishment of the boys he
drew out a small roll of birch bark, secured far
to the north, and handed it to Dick.</p>

<p>Filled with curiosity, the boy opened it with
trembling fingers, to find, just as he had anticipated,
that it was covered with a series of queer
characters, painted after the Indian fashion and
representing men and animals.</p>

<p>“It’s Indian picture writing, you see, Roger!”
Dick declared, “and must be meant for us, or
else this brave would not give it over. He has
been sent here from the far-away Sioux village
to find us, and deliver a message.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, excitedly. “And look,
Dick, there is what seems to be the awkward but
plain picture of a beaver at the end of the message.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
It must have been sent by our good
friend, the chief of the Sioux.”</p>

<p>“You are right that far, Roger, for it is meant
to be the signature of Beaver Tail, himself.
Now to see if we can make out what it says!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>WHAT THE PICTURE WRITING TOLD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was with the utmost eagerness that the two
boys studied the strange characters depicted on
the strip of bark. The hand that had drawn
them there must have been accustomed to the
task, and doubtless the story the message was
meant to tell could have been easily read by the
eyes of any Indian.</p>

<p>Dick and his cousin had seen samples of this
queer picture writing before that time, and understood
how the Indians depend on the natural
sagacity of a woodsman, whether red or white, to
decipher the meaning of the various characters.
(<a id="Note_3r"></a><a href="#Note_3">Note 3</a>.)</p>

<p>“What can it all stand for?” demanded
Roger, as he gazed blankly at the several lines of
characters. “Perhaps we may have to call on
some of the Mandans in the village to explain it
to us.”</p>

<p>“We will do that in the end, anyway,” Dick
said, “in order to make certain; but, if we look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
this over closely, right now, we may get an idea
of what Beaver Tail meant by sending it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think then, Dick, it was intended
just as a greeting to us, so as to let us know the
chief has not forgotten his young paleface
brothers?”</p>

<p>“No, I feel sure it has a more serious meaning
than that,” the other declared. “In fact,
Roger, something tells me it may be in the nature
of a warning.”</p>

<p>“A warning, Dick! Do you mean the Sioux
chief wants us to tell Captain Lewis it will be
all his life is worth to keep heading into the land
of the West, now that spring has come?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking only of ourselves when I said
that, Roger.”</p>

<p>“And that the warning would be for our benefit,
you mean? But, Dick! how could Beaver
Tail, so far away from here, know of any danger
that hung over our heads?”</p>

<p>“Let us examine the bark message, and perhaps
we shall learn something that may explain
the mystery. The first thing we see is what
looks to be a man facing the sun that is half hidden
by the horizon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that hedgehog-looking half circle is
meant for the sun, I can see that. And, further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
along, we find it again, only on the left side of
the man who is now creeping toward it. What
do you make that out to be?”</p>

<p>“It is plain that one represents the rising, and
the other the setting sun,” Dick explained, with
lines of deep thought marked across his forehead.
“Now, an Indian always faces the north
when he wants to represent the points of the
compass, so it is plain that the first sun lies in
the east.”</p>

<p>“And he wanted us to know that this man was
heading into the east first of all; is that what you
mean, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and look closer at the figure, Roger. It
is not intended to be an Indian, you can see, for
he has a hat on his head. It strikes me we ought
to know that hat, cleverly imitated here; what do
you say about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it must be the odd-looking hat that
French trader, François Lascelles, always wore,
Dick. He means that it was toward the rising
sun François started last fall, just as we know
happened. And now here he is, again, the same
hat and all, creeping straight toward the <i>setting</i>
sun. Does that mean the trader came back
again, in spite of the warning Captain Lewis
gave him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sure it means that, and nothing else,”
replied the other, calmly. “Stop and think,
Roger. Only a little while ago, we were wondering
whether such a thing had come about, because
we found reason to believe some member
of the expedition had been hired to do us an injury.
Yes, that bitter Frenchman has dared to
return, believing that he can keep out of the
reach of our protectors, and manage in some
way to get his revenge.”</p>

<p>“If that is what Beaver Tail is trying to tell
us in this picture writing, Dick, the rest of the
screed must simply go on to explain it a little
further.”</p>

<p>“You notice that the same figure with the hat
occurs always,” continued Dick, as he examined
the message again. “Here is what must stand
for a fire, and two persons are sitting beside it,
as if cooking. In what seems to be a clump of
bushes close by he has drawn that man again,
this time lying flat.”</p>

<p>“That must mean that François is spying on
the pair by the fire,” suggested Roger, “and
as he has made both of them wear caps with
’coon or squirrel tails dangling down behind, I
think they are meant to represent us.”</p>

<p>“There can be no question about it,” admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the other, deeply interested. “And, going
further, we see the snake in the grass creeping
up as if he meant to surprise the two, who
are now sleeping, for they lie flat on the
ground.”</p>

<p>“Yes, even the fire burns low, for there is
hardly any blaze,” added Roger, “which indicates
that the hour is late. Why, Dick, we can
read the story as easily as any sign in the woods
we ever tackled.”</p>

<p>“Then comes another scene,” continued Dick,
“where the creeper has evidently sprung with
uplifted knife, upon his intended prey, taken unawares.
After that, we can see him crawling
away, and there are two figures lying stretched
out on the ground close to the now dead fire.
That needs no explanation, Roger; François
Lascelles seeks our lives, because we baffled him
in his scheme to win a fortune at the expense of
our folks at home!”</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other. Their
eyes may have seemed troubled, but there was
no sign of flinching about them. The lads had
met too many perils in times past to shrink, now
that they were face to face with another source
of danger.</p>

<p>“Shall we keep on now for the camp, and show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this message on the bark to Captain Lewis?”
asked Roger.</p>

<p>“It would be the best thing to do, for he can
advise us,” his companion admitted. “Besides,
he will surely order every one in the camp to
keep an eye out for François Lascelles.”</p>

<p>“We ought to take this brave with us, Dick,
because he has come a long way, and is hardly
fit to return without rest and food.”</p>

<p>Once again did Dick endeavor to make the
Sioux warrior comprehend what he wished him
to do. He urged him to get upon his feet, then
thrust an arm through that of the brave, after
which he nodded his head, pointed to the north,
made gestures as though feeding himself, and
then started to walk away, still holding on to the
other.</p>

<p>Of course it was easy for the Indian to understand
that they wished him to accompany them
to their camp, where he would receive food and
attention. He simply gave a guttural grunt,
nodded his head, and fell in behind Dick, after
the customary Indian method of traveling in
single file. Then they moved along, Roger
bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Little was said while they tramped onward,
heading for the camp. Dick occupied himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with making sure that he held to the right direction.
He also found much food for thought in
the startling information that Beaver Tail had
taken the pains to send all these miles to his
young friends.</p>

<p>In due time they came in sight of the camp
where the expedition had passed the preceding
winter. Rude cabins had sheltered them from
the cold and the snow, both of which had been
quite severe in this northern latitude. Some
distance beyond lay the Mandan village, always
a source of deepest interest to the two boys. It
contained so many strange things, and the lads
had never become weary of trying to understand
the ways of these “White Indians.” (<a id="Note_4r"></a><a href="#Note_4">Note 4</a>.)</p>

<p>Upon seeing the boys come in with a strange
Indian in their company, many curious glances
were cast in their direction. Going straight to
the cabin where the two leaders of the expedition
lived, the boys were fortunate enough to find
Captain Lewis busily engaged in making up his
log for the preceding day, though of course there
was little that was new to record.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the boys the Sioux Indian
produced another bark scroll from his ditty bag,
which he handed to Captain Lewis. This fact
convinced Dick that the brave must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with the party in the fall, for he seemed to know
that the white man he faced was the “big chief.”</p>

<p>“What does all this mean, my boys?” asked
the captain, looking puzzled.</p>

<p>“We met with an accident in the rapids, and
had to swim out,” replied Dick. “Then, on the
way back to camp, we came upon this Sioux
brave in a tree with a dozen hungry wolves
jumping up at him. We chased the wolves off,
and looked after his wounds, when to our surprise
he handed us this message from his chief,
Beaver Tail.”</p>

<p>The captain examined the picture writing with
considerable interest. He had been taking considerable
pains since mingling with the Mandans
to understand their ways, and this crude but effective
method of communication had aroused
his curiosity on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>“Read it to me, if you managed to make it out,
Dick,” he told the boy, who only too willingly
complied.</p>

<p>The captain frowned upon learning that, despite
his solemn warning, the French trader had
returned to the neighborhood. That look boded
ill for François Lascelles, should he ever have
the hard luck to be caught in the vicinity of the
camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain’s own communication from the
Sioux chief was merely meant for an expression
of goodwill. Two figures, one plainly a Sioux
chieftain, and the other a soldier, were seen to
be grasping hands as though in greeting.
Beaver Tail by this crude method of picture
writing evidently intended to convey the meaning
that he had not forgotten his friend, the
white chief, and, also, that he had kept his word
that the Sioux should remain on peaceful terms
with the travelers.</p>

<p>“But you spoke of meeting with an accident
in the rapids,” Captain Lewis presently remarked.
“That is something strange for clever
boys like you to experience. Did you miscalculate
the danger, or was it something that could
not be helped?”</p>

<p>“We closely examined our buffalo hide canoe
yesterday, and it was in perfect condition, Captain,”
said Dick. “Yet, with only a slight blow
against a perfectly smooth rock, it split open,
and we had to jump overboard. We managed to
get through the rough water safely, and drew
the damaged boat ashore. Imagine our surprise
and consternation, sir, when we found that
a sharp-pointed knife blade had been run along
the bottom of the canoe, making a deep cut that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had easily given way when we struck the rock.”</p>

<p>“You startle me when you say that, Dick,”
remarked the captain, looking uneasy, though almost
immediately afterward his jaws became set
in a determined fashion, while his eyes gleamed
angrily. “It must mean that we have a traitor
in the camp; some one who has been bought by
the gold of François Lascelles.”</p>

<p>“That was what we began to fear, Captain,”
Dick continued, “and we believed it only right
to let you know what happened to us. We hope
you will send some of the Indians, and one of
our men, for the canoe. It could be brought
secretly to the camp and examined, without the
guilty one knowing about it.”</p>

<p>“A good idea, my boy, and one I shall act
upon at once. Say nothing to a single soul concerning
this outrage. If we expect to catch the
traitor napping, he must not be put on his guard.
But none of us could feel safe, knowing we had
a snake in our midst. Depend upon it, the truth
is bound to come out, and, when once we learn
his identity, the traitor will be kicked out of the
camp, if nothing worse happens to him.”</p>

<p>With this assurance the two boys rested content.
They knew Captain Lewis was a man of
his word, and felt sure that the man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
sold his loyalty for a sum of money offered by
the French trader would before long rue the evil
day he allowed himself to be thus tempted.</p>

<p>Soon afterward they saw Captain Clark and
his companion officer in conference, after which
the former went over to the Mandan village, and,
later on, vanished in the dense forest accompanied
by two stalwart braves. They had gone,
the boys knew to secure the hide canoe that told
the story of treachery in the camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>STALKING THE BUFFALO</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following day orders were given to
prepare to start once more in the direction of the
beckoning West. There was not much to be
done, for, knowing that their departure would
soon be ordered, the men had for some time past
been getting things in readiness.</p>

<p>Dick and Roger had looked their few possessions
over, and were ready to move on short
notice. It gave the boys a little feeling of distress
to realize that they would be thus placing
additional ground between themselves and those
dear ones left at home near the mouth of the
Missouri.</p>

<p>“But we have embarked on the trip,” said
Dick, when his chum was speaking of this as
something he did not like very much, “and must
see it through now. When we do get back home
again, if we are so fortunate, think of all the
wonderful things we shall be able to describe.”</p>

<p>The coming of Captain Lewis just then interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
their confidential talk. Dick expected
that their leader had something of importance to
communicate, and he could give a pretty accurate
guess concerning its nature.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the first words spoken by the
President’s private secretary explained the nature
of his visit to the cabin of the Armstrong
boys.</p>

<p>“I had an opportunity to examine your canoe,
and there can be no reason to doubt that some
unknown miscreant planned to have you lose
your lives in the rapids. It was cleverly done,
and at night-time doubtless, when no one would
be apt to notice him working with your boat.
The knife went in just deep enough to weaken
the whole skin of the bottom, and only a slight
blow was needed to finish the treacherous
work.”</p>

<p>“Of course you have not been able to place
your hand on the guilty party, Captain, have
you?” asked Roger, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nothing has been found out so far,” came
the reply. “One of my reasons for joining you
just now is to ask if either of you have any suspicions.
Although of course we could not accuse
any one on such grounds alone, at the same
time it might narrow our search, and focus attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
on the guilty one, so that he could be
watched, and caught in the act.”</p>

<p>“We do not feel able to say positively, Captain
Lewis,” said Dick, “but when we came to
look over the entire membership of the company
we finally figured it out that it must lie between
three men. All the others seemed to be above
suspicion in our eyes.”</p>

<p>“Tell me who they are, so that I can have
them watched,” demanded the commander.</p>

<p>“There is, first of all, Drewyer, the Canadian
scout. He never seemed to be very friendly
with us, for some reason or other, though we
have had no quarrel. You are surprised to hear
me mention his name, because you have always
trusted him fully. And the chances are, Captain,
that Drewyer is as faithful as the needle to
the pole. I only include him because we know so
little about him.”</p>

<p>“Who is the next one you have on your list?”
asked Captain Lewis. “I count considerably on
your natural sagacity to help in running this
traitor to earth. You boys have learned pretty
well how to judge men from their actions and
looks, rather than from their fair speech. Tell
me the other names, please, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Fields is the second man. I base my right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to include him in the group from the fact that
there was a time when my cousin, here, and
Fields had hot words over something the trapper
had been doing in the village, and which
Roger took him to task for. Since that time
they have been on speaking terms, but I do not
think Fields likes us over much.”</p>

<p>“I should regret very much to learn that
Fields had turned traitor, for I have in the past
been ready to trust him to any extent,” remarked
Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>“The third and last man is Andrew Waller,”
continued Dick. “Now, we have never had a
word with Andrew except in the best of ways.
We have always looked on him as a loyal friend,
and faithful to the trust you put in him. It
has only been of late that both of us noticed
that Andrew seems to try to avoid us, and
when we do meet face to face he lets his eyes
drop.”</p>

<p>“That is indeed a suspicious fact,” commented
the other, quickly. “If money has
tempted him to play the part of a traitor it is
easy to understand how he cannot look you
squarely in the eye. Conscience flays him every
time he sees you near by. I shall certainly bear
in mind what you have told me, and in due time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
results may spring from keeping a close watch
on the movements of these three men.”</p>

<p>With that Captain Lewis left the boys, but
they felt sure he would not allow the matter to
drop. The man whom President Jefferson had
personally selected to manage this big enterprise,
and who had been his own private secretary,
was accustomed to getting results whenever
he attempted anything.</p>

<p>It was on the following morning that camp
was broken, and the expedition once more
started forward—down the Yellowstone to the
Missouri, and up that muddy stream again.
That was an event of vast importance in the lives
of those daring souls who were thus venturing to
plunge deeper into the mysteries of the country
that up to then had never known the imprint of
a white man’s foot.</p>

<p>Although filled with exultation, as were the
rest of the travelers, Dick and his cousin looked
back to see the last of the weird Mandan village
which had long been a source of delight to their
eyes. It was with considerable regret that they
took their farewell view of the painted lodges, as
well as the Indian cemetery on the side of the
hill, where all those platforms, bearing their
mummy-like burdens wrapped in buffalo hides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
told of superstitions that were a part of the
Mandan nature.</p>

<p>During that day they made considerable progress,
and the first camp of the new trail was
pitched on a ridge close to the river. Here the
horses were put out to graze, and the boats
drawn up on the shore, though a guard was constantly
kept to insure against treachery.</p>

<p>Despite the apparent friendship shown by
many of the Indian tribes they encountered on
their long journey of thousands of miles, the two
captains never fully put their trust in the red
men. They believed them as a rule to be treacherous,
and unable to resist pilfering if the opportunity
offered. Especially was this true when
the coveted object was a horse or a “stick that
spat fire,” as the wonderful “shooting-irons” of
the explorers were generally called.</p>

<p>Several days passed with nothing to break the
monotony of the journey. Of course they often
met with minor difficulties, but these were
speedily overcome by a display of that generalship
which had so far made the trip a success.</p>

<p>All this while the boys had not forgotten about
the spy in the camp. Without appearing to do
so, they kept a watch upon the three men upon
whom suspicion had fallen. Had any one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
them offered to leave camp after nightfall, he
would have been trailed by Dick and Roger, bent
on learning what could be the object of his wandering,
and whether he had an appointment with
François Lascelles, the Indian trader.</p>

<p>But, as the days drifted along, and nothing
happened, they began to cherish hopes that perhaps
the accident to their canoe had been rather
an act of vandalism and malice than part of a
deep plan to bring about their death.</p>

<p>A week after leaving the winter camp the
party found itself on the border of a wide plain.
Dick and Roger were mounted and were on a
slight elevation down which they expected to
pass to the level ground near the river, and
await the coming of the boats. From here they
could see for a considerable distance around.</p>

<p>“Look at the herds of buffaloes feeding here
and there, Dick!” exclaimed Roger, whose hunting
instincts were easily aroused. “It strikes
me we heard Captain Clark say the fresh meat
was getting low again. What do you say to
trying to knock over one or two of those fine fellows?”</p>

<p>“We would have to go a considerable distance
to do it, then,” the other told him, “and leave
our horses in the bargain, because they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
used to approaching such fierce-looking animals
as buffalo bulls.”</p>

<p>“But we might be lucky enough to get one or
two yearlings,” persisted Roger, who dearly
loved the excitement of the hunt, as well as the
taste of the well-cooked meat when meal time
came. “I think we could manage to load our
animals down with the spoils, and easily reach
the place where our friends mean to camp for
the night.”</p>

<p>Dick looked around him before replying to
this tempting proposal. He remembered that
they had need to use particular care while away
from the main body of explorers; but so far as
indications went he could not discover the slightest
sign of danger. Certainly there was nothing
to be feared from François Lascelles out there
on that wide stretch of plains, where in various
places they could see timid antelopes and clumsy
buffaloes feeding amidst the isolated stands of
timber which dotted the landscape.</p>

<p>“I see nothing to hinder our making the attempt,
Roger,” he finally remarked.</p>

<p>“Then you agree, do you, Dick?” eagerly demanded
the other young explorer, as he caressed
his gun, and cast a happy look over the panorama
that was spread in front of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s figure out just where our best chance
lies, before we make a start,” he was told.
“We have to keep in mind that it’s necessary to
hide our mounts, so we can creep up on the herd
close to some motte of timber.”</p>

<p>The boys had more than once shot the great,
shaggy animals that in those early days
abounded in countless thousands on the prairies
of the Far West. Their fathers had hunted
buffaloes while on the trail from Virginia to the
banks of the Ohio when boys no older than Dick
and Roger. Hence they were familiar with the
habits of the animals which they now meant to
stalk.</p>

<p>Choosing their course so as to keep a patch of
cottonwoods between themselves and the small
herd they had picked out as their prey, the two
boys urged their horses on at a smart pace. In
several quarters they could see the swift-footed
antelopes vanishing at a surprising pace, frightened
by the approach of these strange animals,
bearing riders on their backs, the like of which
they possibly had never beheld before that
day.</p>

<p>The buffaloes, however, were not so easily
alarmed. Unless they saw an enemy for themselves,
or scented something that caused them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
uneasiness, they were likely to hold their ground
where they chanced to be feeding. (<a id="Note_5r"></a><a href="#Note_5">Note 5</a>.)</p>

<p>Finally the boys decided it was no longer safe
to take their horses with them. The animals
were accordingly secured in a patch of timber,
and the lads, still screened by the other motte,
set forth on foot.</p>

<p>They had possibly a quarter of a mile to walk
before reaching their intended shelter, from the
other side of which they hoped to be able to fire
upon some of the nearest of the herd. The old
grass still lay on the ground, dead and brown;
but shoots of the new spring crop had begun
to thrust their heads up between. It was on
this tender green stuff that the buffaloes were
browsing, and, as it grew more freely in certain
places, such a fact would account for their presence
near the timber.</p>

<p>The one thing Dick and Roger had to be careful
about was the chance of any straggler from
the herd discovering them, and with a bellow giving
the alarm. In order to avoid this if possible,
Dick and his chum bent low as they advanced,
and kept a wary lookout on either side of
the timber.</p>

<p>The breeze blew from the trees toward them.
This fact they had made sure of before starting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
because, otherwise, such is the sense of smell
in the buffaloes they would not have had the
least chance of getting within shooting distance
of the wary animals, who generally feed facing
the wind.</p>

<p>When finally the boys arrived at the edge of
the timber they believed everything was working
as well as they could wish. As yet no sound
had come to their ears that would indicate alarm
on the part of their intended quarry; and Roger
allowed himself to indulge in high hopes of a
hunters’ feast that night, with buffalo meat in
plenty as the main dish.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>HUNTERS, ALL</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Look</span>, Dick, we are not the only hunters,”
whispered Roger, as he tugged at the sleeve of
his cousin’s tunic, and pointed with his rifle.</p>

<p>There was a slight movement in the undergrowth
just ahead of them. Dick, looking in
that direction, was surprised to see a crouching
animal slink away. He instantly recognized it
as a gray timber wolf, and knew the animal must
have been hiding there in hopes of seizing upon
some sort of game.</p>

<p>As a single wolf, however daring, would never
attempt to attack a buffalo, Dick could not understand
at first what the animal meant to do.
He judged, however, that, as this was the spring
of the year, possibly there were calves in the
herd, which would be just the tender sort of
food that the sleek prowler would delight to secure.</p>

<p>The animal drew back his lips at the boys, disclosing
the cruel white fangs; but he knew better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
than to attack such enemies and slunk swiftly
away. After he slid into a thicker part of the
brush the boys lost sight of him, for the time at
least.</p>

<p>Bent upon finding a place where they could get
a fair shot at such animals as seemed best suited
to their needs, the boys crept along. The patch
of timber was not of any great size, and already
they could see the open prairie between the
standing trees.</p>

<p>Again did the keen-eyed Roger make a sudden
discovery that caused him to grip once more the
arm of his companion and point. This time,
however, he did not speak even in a whisper, for
they were very close to the edge of the motte,
and for all they knew some buffalo might be
lying within twenty feet of them.</p>

<p>What Dick saw, as he turned his eyes in the
direction indicated, surprised him very much.
Apparently the tempting bait had drawn another
savage hunter to the spot in hopes of securing
a meal.</p>

<p>It was no Indian brave who sprawled upon the
lowermost limb of that tree, but the lithe figure
of a gray animal which Dick instantly recognized
as a panther, and an unusually big one at
that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The beast was staring hard at them. It did
not move, or offer to attack them, but, just as
the wolf had done, it bared its teeth.</p>

<p>The boys were not looking for trouble with a
brute of this type just then. Food alone held
their thoughts and governed their movements.
On that account Dick did a very wise thing when,
drawing his companion aside, he made a little
detour.</p>

<p>The boys crept as softly as though born spies.
Hardly a leaf fluttered as they moved along, and
certainly no stick cracked under their weight,
for these lads had long ago learned all that
woodcraft could teach them.</p>

<p>Both cast many a curious glance to the right
and to the left, as though wondering what next
they would come upon in the way of hungry, envious
beasts.</p>

<p>After a little while Dick turned again toward
the front, and began to make his way to the edge
of the timber. He had noticed that, at a certain
point, the dead grass extended some thirty feet
away from the trees, and offered splendid
shelter to any one who knew how to utilize it.</p>

<p>Taking an observation after he had crawled
forward to the very edge of the timber, Dick
found that the nearest animals were some little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
distance away. He could count a dozen of them
in sight, and there were two small calves frisking
about their mothers.</p>

<p>Although the grass might be exceptionally fine
close up to the trees, the temptation to feed in
closer was resisted by the buffaloes. They
seemed to know by some intuition that danger
was apt to lurk where timber grew, especially
for the tender calves.</p>

<p>In order to make sure of their shots, it was
desirable for the boys to crawl out amidst that
dead grass. Dick could see that it offered the
finest kind of shelter, and, once they reached its
furthermost limit, the chances of making sure
shots would be just that much enhanced.</p>

<p>Flattening themselves out upon the ground
they crept along on their hands and knees. An
inexperienced hunter could never have performed
the task without attracting the attention
of the feeding buffaloes, and causing a stampede;
but the Armstrong boys had learned how
to accomplish the feat.</p>

<p>Now and then a cautious observation was
taken, and these glances painted the scene
vividly on the minds of the creeping boys.
They could see the coveted yearling cows that it
was their object to secure, the other, older members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of the herds, and, towering above all, the
old bull who ruled the herd.</p>

<p>This last was a terrible object, with the shaggiest
mane the boys had ever seen on a buffalo.
He showed the scars of numerous fierce battles,
and one of his short black horns had been
twisted out of shape in some former combat, so
that it gave him a peculiarly wicked appearance.</p>

<p>Of course, when picking out their game,
neither of the hunters had the slightest idea of
aiming for the patriarch of the herd. He would
be much too tough a morsel for any one to chew,
unless reduced to the point of actual starvation,
when he might be preferable to slicing up one’s
moccasins for soup.</p>

<p>The old fellow seemed to understand his business
as acknowledged guardian of the herd. He
moved hither and thither, and, every once in so
often, stopped to look around him, as though in
search of signs of trouble.</p>

<p>Then he would shake his great head, give a
proud snort of conscious power, strike at the
ground several times with one of his forefeet,
and finally go on with his feeding.</p>

<p>By this time the hunters had arrived at the
point where to proceed further would be to accept
unnecessary risk of detection. They knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
well that, once the alarm was given, the whole
herd would quickly be in motion.</p>

<p>While they might possibly succeed in a shot
taken at a moving target, the chances of a miss
were much greater than they cared to take. So
Dick concluded the time had come for them to
pick out their quarry, take deliberate aim, and
then fire as close together as possible.</p>

<p>A moving form attracted their attention close
to the trees. It was the hungry wolf, possibly
seeking some new shelter. If the feeding animals
noticed the gray form at all they paid little
heed to his presence, having contempt for a
single wolf. It would have been at the risk of
his life for the wolf to make a dash out toward
the herd. Hungry though he probably was,
the slinking beast must have known this, for,
after giving a stretch to his head, as though
longingly sniffing the air, he crept once more
back into the shelter of the timber.</p>

<p>Roger chuckled to himself, though deep down
in his boyish heart he felt sorry for that hunger-tempted
wolf. He was also thinking that, if
their plans turned out well, they would leave a
feast behind sufficient to satisfy the appetites of
both panther and wolf.</p>

<p>One last survey Dick took of the open stretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
before them. He noticed that the old bull was
sniffing the air suspiciously just then. Whether
he had caught traces of their presence, or it was
the fact of the prowling wolf that began to
bother the bull, Dick could not say.</p>

<p>In fact, things had by now reached a stage
where he did not think it mattered. Directly
before them, and in plain sight, were two of the
yearlings, one of them a fine, sturdy-looking
young bull.</p>

<p>Dick, as soon as he clapped his eye on this animal,
selected him as his intended victim. He
knew that such a prize would be a choice morsel
for the camp; and, for that reason, he meant
that his aim should be particularly sure when
the moment arrived to shoot.</p>

<p>“Leave the young bull to me, Roger,” he
whispered under his breath.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Dick,” came the equally
cautious reply, as both rifles were brought
slowly up to the boys’ shoulders.</p>

<p>The leader of the herd stamped his forefoot
angrily on the ground and made the turf fly.
Plainly his suspicions had been aroused.</p>

<p>Dick knew they must delay no longer. The
bull acted as though about to give the alarm
that would cause the whole herd to scamper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wildly off. Now the guns were leveled, and the
cheek of each hunter lay alongside the stock.</p>

<p>“Ready?” asked Dick, softly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” came the immediate reply.</p>

<p>“Then let go!”</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>Both guns let go almost as one, and the feeding
herd was thrown into a wild panic.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>CHARGED BY A BULL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing the boys noticed was the fact
that two of the great beasts had gone down in
answer to their shots. The camp was likely to
have an abundance of fresh meat that night at
least.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="317" height="500" alt="boys running from buffalo" />
<div class="caption">“‘RUN FOR THE TREES, ROGER!’ SHOUTED DICK”</div>
</div>

<p>Then another thing drew their attention.</p>

<p>“Look at the bull!” cried Roger suddenly, as
he noticed that the guardian of the herd was
plunging in their direction as though bent on
seeking a prompt revenge for the loss of his
charges.</p>

<p>The predicament of the boys was not at all
to their liking. Without a bullet in their guns,
and with a maddened bull bearing down upon
them at full speed, unless they made a rapid retreat
to the timber they were in danger of being
gored and trampled by the horns and hoofs of
the beast.</p>

<p>“Run for the trees, Roger!” shouted Dick,
as he himself turned and made for the timber.</p>

<p>Fortunately they were not far from shelter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Roger had before been, inclined to lament the
fact that the mass of dead grass did not allow
them to creep closer to the game, but he changed
his mind now, when every yard counted against
them.</p>

<p>Once Roger caught his foot somehow, and fell
flat. Dick seemed to know it, although his back
was turned to his chum at the time, for he instantly
stopped in his headlong rush and
whirled around. It was his intention to stand
by his comrade, come what would, to divert, if
necessary, the attention of the charging animal
until such time as Roger could gain his feet.</p>

<p>It turned out that the sacrifice was not
needed, for, nimble as a cat, Roger gained his
feet like a flash, and, putting on a fresh spurt,
succeeded in reaching the outermost trees as
soon as Dick.</p>

<p>They were none too soon. The galloping buffalo
was close at their heels. Had the friendly
timber been ten paces further off there might
have been a different story to tell.</p>

<p>Each boy chose a tree behind which he tried
to shield himself. The bull rushed past, but
immediately came to a halt, turned and started
to chase Roger around the tree which he had
taken for a guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Faster, Roger, faster!” called Dick, alarmed
lest the animal overtake the boy.</p>

<p>This shout caused the bull to take notice of
his other enemy, and he plunged directly toward
Dick, who was compelled to make circles around
his shelter at a lively pace, in order to keep from
being impaled on those wicked-looking short
black horns.</p>

<p>Having the inside track the boy of course was
given an advantage, but it seemed as though
that tough old monster would never tire. He
kept on circling the tree, making savage prods
at the legs of his intended quarry whenever
Dick lagged a little, or, slipping, fell back a step
or so.</p>

<p>Roger started just then to give tongue at the
top of his voice, thinking that it was not altogether
fair to have the game so one-sided. His
generous intention was to attract the animal
once more toward himself; and in this he fully
succeeded.</p>

<p>Now it was Roger who danced a tune that was
far from being a stately minuet. Lively boy
that he was, that old rascal of a buffalo bull put
him to his best paces in order to keep out of
danger.</p>

<p>Roger was hard to subdue even at such a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
as this. It would have seemed to be the part of
wisdom to conserve every atom of his breath
for the work before him, yet he was continually
bursting out with shouts to his comrade.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything so mad as he is,
Dick?” he called.</p>

<p>“Be careful, Roger; he almost got you that
time, when he drove his head against the tree.
It may seem like a frolic to you, but the danger
is there all the same!”</p>

<p>“It’s the greatest race I ever had, barring
none!” gasped the other, as he continued to
dodge the horns that were forever trying to
catch him off his guard.</p>

<p>“Better throw your gun away, for it’s likely
to trip you!” advised Dick; and hardly had the
words escaped his lips than there came another
sudden change of tactics on the part of the
charging bull, with Dick again doing the dodging.</p>

<p>Roger took this occasion to change his tree,
selecting one that offered a little better chance
for making a speedy circuit, for of course he
anticipated soon coaxing the infuriated animal
to turn back on him.</p>

<p>There had been another reason for his change
of base which was made apparent a little later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on. Dick was making splendid time around that
trunk. He also managed to keep a close watch
upon his shaggy antagonist, and was thus able
to anticipate the latter when, with a sudden stop
and a whirl the bull sought to catch him napping
and come up in the rear.</p>

<p>“Dick, I’ve got a plan!” cried Roger.</p>

<p>“Tell me what it is then,” panted the other,
plainly distressed for want of breath, for the
constant struggle to avoid the horns of the bull
was telling on him.</p>

<p>“I must get him started after me again, you
see,” Roger commenced to explain.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course!” Dick managed to say as he
found a few seconds of relief while the animal
stood pawing the ground, and apparently debating
within his mind what course he should take
next.</p>

<p>“I’m a little the more agile, you see,” continued
Roger, “and likely to tire him out in the
end, if put to it.”</p>

<p>“All very well,” Dick told him, “but where
do I come in?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I figured on your loading your gun, and
fixing him in a hurry!” said Roger, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Dick even joined in that expression of merriment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Strange that up to then neither of them
seemed to have given the first thought to the
fact that he gripped a fire-arm in his hand, which
it would take only a short time to put in serviceable
condition.</p>

<p>“Well said, Roger! and, if you can coax the
old fellow to make a change in his program, I’ll
look after the gun part of the affair, I promise
you.”</p>

<p>“Look out, he’s after you again, Dick!”</p>

<p>Dick knew that long before Roger could get
the words of warning framed, and he was speedily
making his rapid circuits around the tree
with the snorting animal hot on his heels.</p>

<p>With the intention of carrying out his part of
the arrangement Roger now started to shout and
make all manner of derisive gestures by which
he hoped to attract the attention, and excite the
ire, of the raging animal.</p>

<p>It was some time before this maneuver met
with the success Roger hoped for, but in the end
he managed to coax the bull into making a dash
toward his tree. Thereupon Roger exerted
himself to keep the animal busy, so that Dick
should not be interrupted in his task.</p>

<p>In order to do this the better he kept up his
jeering cries, and, when he found the chance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
even made thrusts at the beast with his
long gun, once striking him smartly on the
head.</p>

<p>The pace was beginning to tell on the buffalo.
His powers of endurance had diminished since
that eventful day when in mortal combat he had
slain the old guardian of the herd, and usurped
his position of trust.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dick was far from being idle.</p>

<p>He had, as soon as the attention of the bull
was diverted, swung his powder horn around,
after removing the wooden stopper, and carefully
measured out a charge. This he managed
to pour down the barrel of his rifle, after which,
from the cavity in the stock of the weapon, he
took a greased patch in which the bullet was to
be enclosed. After that the ramrod was used
to punch the bullet down into the interior of the
long barrel until it finally lodged snugly upon
the powder charge.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but the priming, which was
a brief matter at the most; and Dick was gladdened
by the thought that now he held in his
hand the means for terminating that ridiculous
dance which the old bull was leading Roger.</p>

<p>A tree interfered somewhat with his view, and
Dick ran a little closer, in order to make certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of his aim. Dropping on one knee after the
fashion of expert marksmen of the day, he
waited until there came a little lull in the mad
chase.</p>

<p>“Now you can get him, Dick!” called Roger,
between his gasps for breath, as the bull stopped
short to strike again his hoof violently against
the ground.</p>

<p>It was the opening the pioneer boy had been
waiting for, and immediately the long gun shot
out a puff of smoke as the report sounded. The
buffalo had been hit in a vital spot, for he fell
to the ground without even one jump.</p>

<p>Roger started to give a triumphant shout,
when he cut it short, for something had leaped
through the air; and, upon looking at the still-quivering
body of the stricken bull, what was
the boy’s surprise to see a crouching figure
fastened upon it, and to hear the vicious snarl
of the savage panther as, with ears pressed back
against his head, he glared defiantly at the
young hunter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>PLANNING A SURPRISE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">More</span> trouble ahead!” cried Roger, starting
back, for he did not fancy a hand-to-hand conflict
with that furious beast, intent on claiming
the game that had fallen to Dick’s gun.</p>

<p>“Do nothing rash!” admonished the other,
who knew the headstrong ways of his cousin,
and wished to prevent any action that might
precipitate a struggle.</p>

<p>“But see how the beast acts! As if he owned
the earth, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” came the steady reply,
for Dick was hastening his reloading operations
while talking, something Roger did not seem to
have thought of.</p>

<p>“But you shot the bull, Dick,” urged the
other.</p>

<p>“Then I make of him a present to our friend,
the big cat,” Dick told him. “We have quite
enough meat out on the open, all we can manage.
Besides, I pity your teeth if you ever try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to bite into the flesh of that tough old rascal.
Move around, and let the cat be. That’s all he
asks of us.”</p>

<p>“But, Dick, I don’t like to let it seem as
though the two of us were afraid of just a hungry
panther,” remonstrated Roger, who was
proud of his valor.</p>

<p>“Oh! for that matter, there’s the poor old
wolf, you remember. And in a short time the
air will be black with buzzards coming to the
feast from a distance of miles around. Let
good enough alone, as I’ve heard your mother
tell you, many’s the time.”</p>

<p>Grumbling a little, and sending more than one
aggressive look backward toward the audacious
panther, Roger finally agreed to accompany his
chum out to where the other victims lay.</p>

<p>The rest of the herd had galloped away, and
were far distant by this time, though now lacking
a gallant protector. And, lying where they
had fallen, were the yearling bull and another,
for both boys had made capital shots.</p>

<p>“What shall we do first?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“I want to see you charge that rifle of yours
before we start a single thing,” he was told
bluntly by his companion.</p>

<p>“Oh! I had forgotten that part of the game,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
but you know I generally do reload without any
loss of time, Dick. I learned that long years
ago, and many a time, as I can distinctly remember,
it saved me a heap of trouble.”</p>

<p>This duty having been accomplished, Roger
waited to hear what they were to attempt next;
for as a rule he was content to let Dick do the
planning.</p>

<p>“While you go and fetch the horses, Roger,
I’ll start to cutting up this fine young bull.
You’ve got your bearings, of course, and know
just where we left our mounts?”</p>

<p>“I surely do know,” the other replied, “and
I’ll have them here before long. If I were you,
Dick, I’d keep one eye out for that slippery
beast of a panther. For all any one can say,
he may take a notion that he prefers tender meat
to tough. And that I’d call carrying the joke
too far.”</p>

<p>“Depend on it, Roger, I’ll keep my gun handy
all the while, and, if Mr. Panther gives me any
trouble, I’ll be tempted to waste a bullet on him.
Get back as soon as you can, that’s all.”</p>

<p>With that advice ringing in his ears Roger
hurried off, while Dick, drawing his hunting
knife with the buckhorn handle, proceeded to
first remove most of the skin of the young bull,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
so that it could be used to wrap around the
meat. After this he started to cut away such
choice portions as he meant to keep.</p>

<p>Every now and then as was his habit, he
raised his head to take a quick glance around;
but neither the panther nor the wolf came into
sight. Evidently the hungry animals were not
excessively particular about the tenderness of
their meat, if only the supply proved sufficient.</p>

<p>Roger came galloping up after a bit, leading
the second horse. The animal did considerable
snorting, as horses always will when they scent
freshly spilled blood; but Roger knew how to
stake them out so that they could not wander
away.</p>

<p>After that he commenced dressing the second
buffalo, also a yearling. Since both boys had
had considerable experience in this, they made
fair work, and the two piles of fresh meat
mounted up by degrees.</p>

<p>It was just as well, for evening was not far
away now, the day having drawn on toward its
close. Off yonder, in the glowing west, the sun
was sinking, and beginning to paint the fleecy
white clouds a vivid red that had strange fluted
columns running up and down. To the imagination
of the two boys these were the beckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
fingers that tempted them always, just as the
rainbow for ages past has promised a pot of
gold to him who could find the spot where its
foot rested on the earth.</p>

<p>The two bundles of meat were tied securely,
and fastened to the backs of the prancing horses.
Then the boys set off, expecting to strike the
camp of the expedition along the bank of the
river.</p>

<p>As they passed the timber they could see
something of a commotion in the place where
they had had their adventure with the savage
old buffalo bull. Dozens of big bald-headed
birds were sitting on dead limbs of the trees,
now dropping awkwardly down to the ground,
and anon flapping back to their perches.</p>

<p>“The buzzards came, just as I thought they
would,” remarked Dick; “but they’ll have to
wait for the second table, because that cat and
the wolf must first be served. When they can
hold no more they may go away and let the poor
buzzards have a chance.”</p>

<p>Dick did not have any particular trouble in
finding his bearings. It had been indelibly impressed
on his mind that the river lay to the
north, and, with the setting sun on their left, it
would be no difficult task to find the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He had also figured out about where the boats
and the horses would bring up when the day’s
toll had been taken, so that he was now making
what he would have called a bee-line for that
particular place.</p>

<p>The sun was down behind the level horizon at
last, and shadows had begun to creep out of
their hiding-places. Roger began to feel a little
anxiety concerning their hoped-for arrival at
the river.</p>

<p>“It seems to be further than I thought,” he
ventured to say presently.</p>

<p>“Meaning the river, I suppose,” remarked
Dick, calmly. “Yes, I expected that it would
take us some little time to get there, because
there was a big bend just at the place we left
the water, on sighting that hill which we climbed
to look around for game.”</p>

<p>“Dick, I believe I see something that flickers
ahead of us!” exclaimed Roger just then.</p>

<p>“It must be the light of the fires, which as
usual have been built below the river-bank, so
that their glow may not betray the camp to hostile
eyes. Yes, just as you say, Roger, we are
getting there, and will be in on time.”</p>

<p>“Oh! as to that, Dick,” said the other with
a laugh, “even if supper is started they will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sure to switch off and give this fresh buffalo
meat the first showing. But, for one, I shall
be glad to rest. After all that prancing around
my tree every muscle in my legs cries out in
pain, I do believe.”</p>

<p>They were not long in arriving at the camp,
and, when the campers found what the packages
that the horses carried contained, they greeted
the newcomers with cheery words of welcome
and of thanks.</p>

<p>It was a lively scene, with the boats drawn up
on the sandy beach under the river-bank; the
horses picketed out to graze; the tents that had
been erected to serve as sleeping quarters for
the company; and the blazing fires about which
the cooks were starting to cook the evening
meal. For a background to the picture there
was the ever-murmuring river, and the boys,
many a time, wished they were able to send a
loving message down those hundreds of miles to
the little settlement of St. Louis, where their
loved ones dwelt.</p>

<p>They knew that a monumental task still lay
before them, since the terrible, rocky mountains,
of which they had heard vague stories from the
Indians, had to be scaled, as well as trackless
wastes of desert land crossed, before they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
hope to feast their eyes on the blue sea which
was their goal.</p>

<p>Still, the whole summer lay before them, and
they had already surmounted so many obstacles
that nothing seemed to daunt those bold spirits.
Each day’s journey they counted another link
in the chain, and, having virtually burned their
bridges behind them, it became a necessity that
they succeed.</p>

<p>The supper was finally cooked, and those who
were not on duty as guards settled down to enjoy
what had been prepared. As usual Dick
and Roger found places close together, for they
were chums in everything, and liked to chat
while eating.</p>

<p>“This pays me for all my trouble with that
old bull,” remarked Roger as he munched away.
“Sweeter meat I never tasted, if I do say it
myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I agree with you there,” Dick told him.
“But I find myself wondering why Captain
Lewis keeps looking over this way so often.
And then, too, it strikes me he is unusually solemn
to-night. What do you say, Roger?”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t noticed it before,” came the reply
presently, “but, now that you call my attention
to the fact, I really believe you are right. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
does look as if something had gone wrong. I
wonder what could have happened while we
were away this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“We may have to take it out in guessing,”
Dick observed, “unless the Captain decides to
tell us about it, which is hardly likely. But the
rest of the men seem to be noisier and in better
humor than usual. There’s Andrew Waller
keeping a lot of them roaring with laughter as
he tells some comical story. I never saw him
so lively, come to think of it.”</p>

<p>About the time all of them were through eating,
Dick discovered that Captain Meriwether
Lewis was walking directly toward the spot
where he and his chum still sat. A couple of
convenient stones had afforded them resting
places; but, as the commander of the expedition
paused beside them, both lads immediately
sprang to their feet, courteously offering the
captain a seat.</p>

<p>“I will accept if one of you can sit tailor-fashion
on the ground,” remarked Captain Lewis,
but without any sign of merriment in his voice,
for he was still looking very grave. “I want to
speak with both of you lads, and it is concerning
a subject in which you are deeply interested.”</p>

<p>Of course that aroused their curiosity at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and Roger lost no time in dropping upon the
sand, where he could make himself fairly comfortable.</p>

<p>As soon as they were all seated again the captain
began:</p>

<p>“While you two boys were away on your hunt
this afternoon, something happened which deepened
my suspicion that we have a traitor among
us. By a mere accident I picked up a bit of
paper that some one must have drawn from his
pocket unknown to himself. Glancing idly at it
I was startled at what I read.”</p>

<p>He looked around him as though to make certain
that no eye watched his action, and then
placed a small piece of paper, very much wrinkled
and soiled, in Dick’s hand. Together the
boys fastened their eyes on the writing and
made out the fragment of a sentence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“if you think it unsafe to stay longer in the
camp, join us; but be sure and bring plenty
of guns and ammunition along, for we need
them.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was no signature, but the boys did not
doubt in the least that the one whose hand had
Penned this note of instructions was François
Lascelles or his equally rascally son, Alexis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
The question was, who could the recipient be,
and how were they to find out.</p>

<p>“After you found this paper, Captain, you
watched to see if any one seemed to be searching
for anything, I suppose?” Dick asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“All the afternoon I have kept on the alert,
but, whoever the villain is, he has either not
discovered his loss, or else has assumed an appearance
of indifference in order to blind hostile
eyes.”</p>

<p>“But how do you suppose he could have received
the message?” continued Dick.</p>

<p>“That, too, may always remain a mystery,”
continued the other, reflectively, “but an arrangement
could have been made whereby certain
stones that were laid down in a peculiar
manner would direct him to search in a hollow
stump or under a log for a letter. All we know
is that this traitor did receive his message, and
started to tear it to pieces, but on second thought
kept part of the letter.”</p>

<p>“It will be his undoing yet, sir, I think,”
Roger ventured to suggest. “Too bad there
was no name mentioned, so we could charge him
with the deed, and punish him as he deserves.
I am wild to know who he is, for I shall long remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
how he tried to put an end to us in the
rapids of the Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you may, and that before another
dawn comes,” remarked the captain, as he
smiled indulgently at the headstrong boy, whom
he had come to like very much, as, indeed, he did
Dick, also.</p>

<p>“That sounds as though you had made a plan
of campaign, Captain,” Dick observed, with a
pleased look that was only exceeded by the smile
on the face of his companion.</p>

<p>“I have laid out a little scheme which I think
may work well, and trap the guilty wretch in the
toils,” explained the captain. “You remember
the special mention made of guns and ammunition,
which he was told to take with him, if he
really believed his usefulness in the camp had
come to an end? That gave me my clew.”</p>

<p>“The bait will be a stock of powder and ball,
and perhaps several guns, unless I fail to catch
your meaning, sir?” Dick continued.</p>

<p>“Before we go to sleep, to-night, I shall have
three men, whose names I need not mention,
know that there are several good guns, and
quite a quantity of ammunition for them, in the
supply tent where we keep our extra provisions.
It is not guarded beyond the fact that sentries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
are posted outside the camp to watch for enemies.
But to-night both of you boys, together
with myself and Captain Clark, will be in hiding,
ready to capture any one who ventures to
enter that supply tent.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for thinking of us, sir,” exclaimed
Roger, warmly.</p>

<p>“Why should I not do so, when the first intimation
I received that there was a traitor in the
camp came through you two boys? And, besides,
you are more deeply interested in his capture
and punishment than any of the others, because
this unknown spy is working hand and
glove with François Lascelles, who hates you
most bitterly.”</p>

<p>“Tell us what to do, Captain, and you can rely
on our working with you to the best of our ability,”
Dick assured the commander, who smiled
at him and went on to explain further.</p>

<p>“Understand then, that, later on, both of you,
when not observed, are to take your guns and
disappear. I will look to find you in that bunch
of brush yonder to the right, and from that
point we can watch the supply tent until something
happens. I think the bait will be sufficiently
attractive to tempt the man to make his
move, meaning to steal the guns and ammunition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
after which he hopes to leave us in the
lurch. After we make sure that he is inside the
tent, we can creep up and face him as he comes
out laden with his booty. That is enough, since
you understand,” with which the captain laughingly
arose to his feet and sauntered away, leaving
the boys thrilled through and through.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>SPRINGING THE TRAP</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I wonder</span> if the plan will work?” remarked
Roger, when he and Dick once more found themselves
alone, the captain having sauntered over
to where some of the men were joking, Andrew
Waller being the life of the company.</p>

<p>“If that torn part of a message meant anything,”
Dick told him, “and Captain Lewis is
able to bait the trap in the right way, I believe
this night will see the answer to the question
that has been bothering us so long.”</p>

<p>“Meaning that we will learn who the traitor
is?” continued the other.</p>

<p>“Yes. Right now we are no nearer the truth
than a week ago, you know, Roger. It may be
any one of the three men we had in mind; or
some one else, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“Look at Andrew Waller, Dick. He seems to
be in high spirits! Do you think that is all put
on for effect? From the way he acts no one
could ever dream he had an evil thought in his
heart for his comrades of the long trail.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“As we exhausted that subject a long time
ago, Roger, and have learned nothing new since,
there’s no use trying to figure things out. Better
wait, and, as my father says, ‘hold our
horses’ until the trap is sprung—if it ever is.”</p>

<p>“But, if we do trip him up,” continued Roger,
reflectively, “what do you believe Captain Lewis
will do to the wretch?”</p>

<p>“He has not given us even a hint on that
score,” Dick replied.</p>

<p>“If the man is a traitor, and really tried to
take our lives for pay, it seems to me it would
be a shame if he were only drummed out of camp
for such things. I know what Captain Clark
would do if it rested in his hands.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I can guess the answer there, too,
Roger; because he is a soldier, with stern ideas
of what treachery means. But Captain Lewis
has a tender heart, for all he can be so firm. He
is very fond of the men who have clung to his
fortunes in this great journey into the unknown
country of the West.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean to say, Dick, he would
forgive the rascal on that account?” demanded
Roger, with a frown of displeasure on his face.</p>

<p>“Not exactly that,” hastily replied the other
lad. “I am sure that he would not want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
trust such a man again, but, at the same time,
Captain Lewis would not believe it necessary to
have the traitor shot, as a soldier would.”</p>

<p>“In that case there would be only one other
thing to do,” observed Roger, disconsolately;
“which would be to kick him out of camp, and
warn him, just as he did Lascelles, that if he
ever allowed himself to be seen near the camp
again it would be at his peril.”</p>

<p>“Mark my words, Roger, if we are lucky
enough to catch the man in the act, that is what
will happen to him. But, before he goes, he will
listen to a ringing talk from Captain Lewis that
will make his cheeks burn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and not for all the money Lascelles ever
owned would I want to have such a fine man as
Captain Lewis tell me that, as a traitor to my
trust, I had sunk down until I was beneath contempt.
But I wonder, Dick, how he will manage
to let them know about the rifles and ammunition
in the supply tent?”</p>

<p>“Depend on it the captain has that arranged
cleverly enough,” Dick declared, “and he will
accomplish it without awakening any suspicion
that it has been done for a purpose.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do next?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“Wait for his signal as arranged with us,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
explained Dick. “When we get that, it is our
duty to slip out of camp without being noticed,
and settle down in that patch of brush, just as
he said. Later on, he will join us there, and
bring Captain Clark with him.”</p>

<p>They sat there and exchanged words for quite
a long time, while the evening waned, and some
of the tired men, who had been poling or rowing
all day, began to creep into the tents, or, it might
be, under rude bough shelters, where they expected
to sleep through the remainder of the
night.</p>

<p>“The time has come at last,” said Dick, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>“Did you see Captain Lewis make the gesture
he explained to us?” asked his chum.</p>

<p>“Yes, and now let us see how smartly we can
carry out our part of the game, as we laid it out
in advance.”</p>

<p>After surveying the field, the boys concluded
that, by pretending to settle down in a certain
place, they could withdraw by degrees without
being noticed, and come up in the rear of the
patch of bushes marked by the commander as
the meeting spot.</p>

<p>This maneuver was accomplished with considerable
skill, because both lads were well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
drilled in Indian ways, and could snake their
way along the ground as well as any painted
brave on the warpath, seeking to spy on the
enemy’s camp.</p>

<p>In due time, therefore, they crept into the
bushes, and settled down to await the coming of
the two captains. Just as they expected, from
their place of hiding it was possible to keep a
close watch upon the supply tent, though the
latter stood in the shadows, with the firelight
playing on one side of it only.</p>

<p>Slowly the minutes crept along. The boys
rarely exchanged words, and then only in the
lowest of whispers; nor did they make any sort
of move, lest in some way keen eyes discover
their presence amidst the bushes.</p>

<p>It seemed ages before Roger pressed the arm
of his cousin, and spoke in his ear.</p>

<p>“Something moving behind us, Dick!”</p>

<p>The other had also caught a faint rustling
sound, and knew that in all probability the two
captains must be about to join them. Surely
enough, in a short time the men reached the side
of the boys, exercising all the skill possible to
avoid making their presence known to others.</p>

<p>Few words passed between them, for the plan
of campaign had been laid out, and each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
knew what lay before them. The firelight flickered
upon the side of the supply tent, and it was
in this quarter mostly that their gaze was fastened.
In fact, Captain Lewis and his fellow
officer depended wholly on the wide-awake boys
to let them know when anything happened, for
they themselves lay stretched out at full length
upon the ground.</p>

<p>One by one the men sitting by the fire began
to vanish, some yawning, and others simply
stretching themselves with the air of weariness
natural after a strenuous day at the oars.</p>

<p>Finally an atmosphere of desertion seemed to
have come upon the camp. The fire died down
slowly, and not a movement could be seen.
Somewhere, near by, the appointed sentries
stood guard, but their duty was wholly in the
line of making sure that an enemy did not surprise
the adventurous company from without.
Those in the camp were supposed to be above
suspicion.</p>

<p>Roger was beginning to grow impatient. The
minutes were dragging along, so far as he was
concerned, and he began to fear that, after all,
the scheme, so cleverly planned by Captain
Lewis, would fail to be a success.</p>

<p>What if the fellow had become suspicious, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
determined not to allow himself to be attracted
by the bait? They would have their long night
vigil for nothing, and be no nearer to learning
the truth than before. Roger lacked the patience
and perseverance of his chum, though he
had many good qualities of his own.</p>

<p>It must have been almost midnight when Dick
caught sight of a shadowy figure moving just
beyond the supply tent. At first he thought it
might be a wolf that had boldly crept into the
camp, though such a thing seemed absurd; then
he became satisfied that it must be a man on his
hands and knees, crawling along slowly, and
heading for the isolated tent.</p>

<p>When satisfied in this respect he whispered
in the ear of Roger, and touched both the recumbent
captains on the arm. This had been a signal
agreed on in case of necessity, and, as they
were on the alert, they lost no time in making
good use of their eyes.</p>

<p>The creeper was now close to the tent. Every
few feet he would sink down flat to the ground,
and remain perfectly still for a time. No doubt
at such intervals the man was listening intently
to discover the slightest movement in the camp
that might mean danger to him.</p>

<p>Both boys fairly held their breath when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
saw the shadowy figure reach the tent and
hastily creep under the flap. Just how long it
would take him to find what he was after no one
could say, but the time had arrived for those
who were watching the tent to make a forward
move.</p>

<p>Fortunately the breeze started up just then,
and rustled the leaves of the trees overhead. It
came from a quarter that also bore the sounds
of the fretting river, where rocky reefs impeded
the progress of the current; so that a combination
of sounds helped to deaden any little rustling
noise the four watchers might make in rising
to their feet and moving forward.</p>

<p>Every detail had been arranged, and they
made immediately for the darker side of the
tent. This was to avoid having their shadows
appear on the canvas, and arousing the suspicions
of the thief.</p>

<p>Having taken up their positions here, they
waited for what was to follow, confident that the
guilty one could not possibly escape them.</p>

<p>He could be heard moving around inside the
tent. Once he upset some object that fell to the
ground with a soft thud, and they even heard his
low muttered exclamation of annoyance. After
that all was still for an interval, as doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
he strained his hearing to learn whether the
sound had aroused any curiosity in the mind of
a sentry.</p>

<p>Then the movements started again, proving
that renewed confidence was making the marauder
bolder.</p>

<p>Dick and Roger had their guns ready, according
to orders. If the man attempted to escape
after being ordered to surrender their duty
would be to shoot, although the endeavor would
be to wound instead of to kill.</p>

<p>The movements within the tent had now
ceased, and it was probable that the man had
secured all he sought to acquire. That meant
his next act would be to make his exit. Dick
had not overlooked the chance of his creeping
under the canvas at the rear of the tent, and,
if they failed to see anything of him by the time
another minute passed, he meant to creep
around and ascertain whether this had been attempted.</p>

<p>Roger, giving a faint gasp, warned his chum
that some one was coming. Then all of them
caught sight of a dusky figure bending low as it
crept out of the tent.</p>

<p>“Stand still and surrender, or you are a dead
man!” suddenly exclaimed Captain Lewis, as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
with his three companions, he stepped forward.</p>

<p>The thief made no attempt to run, for he knew
what the result must be when he saw those rifles
in the hands of the two boys. So they pushed
up until they could make sure of his identity;
and somehow neither Roger nor Dick felt any
great surprise when they discovered that the
man they had captured was Andrew Waller.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>BANISHED FROM CAMP</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man held a couple of guns in his hands
and was apparently loaded down with the ammunition
that had been left as a most attractive
bait. He hung his head as if at first overcome
with a sense of shame; nor could the boys blame
him for giving way to this feeling.</p>

<p>Some of the other men, awakened by the loud
command of Captain Lewis, now came hurrying
toward the spot. They were undoubtedly
greatly astonished to discover what was taking
place. And among the first to arrive were
Drewyer and Fields, the two who in turn had
been unjustly suspected of being the guilty person.</p>

<p>“Take those guns away from him,” ordered
Captain Lewis, “and then search him for ammunition!
He was carrying off a good part of
our visible supply, and meant to join forces with
those rascally Frenchmen we let go last fall, fellows
who are once more hanging about our trail
for evil purposes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Waller made no attempt to resist. Indeed, it
would have been a foolish thing on his part, and
could only have resulted in his being roughly
treated. So presently they had stripped him of
all his stolen goods, and even his own gun had
been taken away.</p>

<p>After that he had to listen to the stinging
words of reproach which Captain Lewis heaped
upon him.</p>

<p>“The man who betrays his trust as you have
done, Waller,” said the other in conclusion, “deserves
to be stood up before a file of soldiers
and shot. That fate, indeed, would be your portion
if you were an enlisted man, and had taken
the oath of fidelity to the country. As it is I intend
simply to send you out of this camp with
the scorn of all honest men ringing in your ears.
You can find those French friends of yours and
make your bed with them.”</p>

<p>“But you will not think of turning me out into
the wilderness without some weapon with which
to secure food, or to protect myself against the
wild beasts?” the man found his tongue to say,
with anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>“Gun you shall have none, in punishment for
your offense,” he was sternly told. “Your
hunting knife and a hatchet will be given to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
also a certain amount of provisions, sufficient to
last you several days. For the rest, look you
to those friends whose gold you accepted to betray
these lads; for we can now understand who
it was knifed their skin boat so that it might
sink with them in the rapids!”</p>

<p>The man at bay opened his mouth as though
tempted to declare that he had had nothing to do
with such a base affair; but, on second thought,
he stifled his intended denial. He must have
decided that, since exposure had come, the less
he had to say the better it would be for him in
the end.</p>

<p>Under the orders of Captain Lewis his knife
and hatchet were returned to him. Then a
package of food was made ready and also given
into his charge. Some of the men were grumbling
to themselves, as though they did not approve
of such leniency, for, according to their
way of thinking, a traitor deserved but one punishment,
and one that would place it out of his
power to repeat his fault.</p>

<p>The man did not attempt to plead for mercy.
He had a certain amount of pride; and, besides,
he feared lest he be turned over to the soldiers
for punishment, and he knew what to expect in
that case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now go forth,” Captain Lewis told him,
“and seek your new friends, or join the Indians
whose treacherous ways you have even shamed
by your acts. We warn you not to be seen again
by any in this camp. Such is your reward for
turning against those who trusted you. That
is all.”</p>

<p>Waller drew a long breath. He knew what
it meant for him, should he fail to find the
Frenchmen. Hundreds of miles lay between
that spot and the nearest white settlement; and,
unless he could get in touch with some of the
Indian tribes along the Missouri, he would
starve by the time another winter came around.</p>

<p>Being a woodsman, Waller of course knew
many of the secrets of Nature, and could prolong
his life by means of clever snares in which
to catch small animals; but, with the coming of
cold weather, his case would be pitiful unless he
had help.</p>

<p>Dick felt sorry for the man at first. He believed
Waller had simply yielded to temptation
when he accepted the Frenchman’s gold and
agreed to work in his interest.</p>

<p>That feeling, however, did not last long, for,
as the man started to leave the camp, he looked
at the staring men contemptuously, and, on passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the two boys, scowled blackly, as the light
of the resurrected fire disclosed.</p>

<p>“We may meet again!” he told Roger as he
passed him; and there was a deep significance
back of the words.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was fortunate for Andrew Waller
that Captain Clark did not happen to hear what
he muttered; for the soldier might have insisted
that some more drastic punishment, than mere
dismissal from the camp, be visited upon the
culprit. But the threat was not heard by those
in authority, and Waller went out into the darkness,
and they saw no more of him for the time.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the night the boys
slept peacefully. It was a great satisfaction to
them both to feel that the mystery had now been
solved, and that they need no longer fear treachery
in the camp.</p>

<p>Then again it pleased Dick to know that
neither Drewyer nor Fields had been connected
with the plot against them, for he was very fond
of both men, in a way, and had always believed
them to be as honest as they were capable. History
has written their names on the scroll of
honor whereby the heroes of this remarkable enterprise
are ever to be remembered.</p>

<p>On the following morning the journey was resumed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Day succeeded day, and in many particulars
they were very much alike. The travelers
had difficulties to surmount, and often met
with delays that were exasperating; but through
it all shone that indomitable spirit that would
not admit defeat.</p>

<p>“We have come too far to quit now,” Captain
Lewis would say when they were facing some
new difficulty, “and the only thing to do is to
push ahead despite temporary checks. The
goal will soon be in sight, and the victory won.
Then will come the reward when all men honor
our names, and give us our meed of praise. It
will be worth all it costs to win the thanks of
the whole nation.”</p>

<p>In this manner he cheered them when their
spirits drooped. There never could have been a
finer leader for such a tremendous undertaking
than the former private secretary of President
Jefferson. Every man in all that company felt
that he would willingly go through fire and flood
for Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>From time to time they met with Indians on
the river, or came to some village on the bank.
These natives had never as yet seen white men,
and were, as a rule, disposed to be friendly.
They seemed to have learned about a Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Father far away toward the rising sun, who was
very rich and powerful, and whose favor it
might pay them to seek.</p>

<p>Among the trappers connected with the party
there were always those who could communicate
with the Indians, partly by signs, but also with
the aid of other and allied Indian tongues. In
this way, then, it was possible to learn much concerning
the nature of the country toward the
west.</p>

<p>Strange, indeed, were many of the stories that
came to the ears of the travelers. They heard
of burning deserts, where for ten days they
would find nothing but wastes of sand, except
for a few cacti, or prickly pears. Here they
were likely to leave their bones to the vultures
and the prowling coyotes—the latter a small species
of the wolf tribe, which the men of the expedition
had begun to notice collecting about
their camp at nights. These animals kept up a
miserable chant in chorus, but they possessed a
very cowardly nature, quite unlike the gray timber
wolf.</p>

<p>If Captain Lewis and his followers had not
possessed stout hearts they would have been dismayed
by all they heard of the country lying
beyond. The mountains reached above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
clouds, rearing themselves in a most forbidding
way, and were exceedingly rocky and devoid of
vegetation.</p>

<p>Besides, there were tribes of fierce Indians living
in the deep canyons who would lie in wait to
overwhelm the pilgrims in hopes of obtaining
their horses and those wonderful sticks that
spat out fire. The beasts inhabiting those elevations
were also awe inspiring, especially the
bears, which, as the travelers already knew,
were of the ferocious variety known as grizzlies.</p>

<p>In spite of all these thrilling stories there was
no disposition manifested on the part of the explorers
to back down. They had already met
many perils without flinching, and it was too late
now to show the white feather.</p>

<p>The summer was now well along, and, before
a great while, they could expect to arrive at the
headwaters of the Big Muddy. The two captains
had decided that, when it was no longer
possible to continue with the boats, they would
make a permanent camp, where a portion of the
expedition could spend the coming winter, while
a certain number pushed on, to cross the rocky
barrier and reach the sea, if such an accomplishment
could be carried out.</p>

<p>Every day began to see changes in the flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
current upon which they had been voyaging for
so many months. Remembering its extreme
width, down where their homes were located, it
was hard indeed for the boys to believe that this
narrow ribbon of clear water was the same
stream.</p>

<p>“All that its banks hold these days,” Dick
had explained to Roger when the other was expressing
these ideas, “comes from the melting
snows away up in those mountains whose tops
we sometimes think we can see far, far away
to the west. That is why it is so clear and cold,
and the fish we catch now are not like the ones
we have often brought in to our mothers at
home.”</p>

<p>“The beautiful one, with the specks that were
all the colors of the rainbow, must have been
some kind of trout,” Roger continued, his face
lighting up eagerly, for he was a born angler,
“and I only hope we are able to catch many more
of the same kind. I never tasted such a fine
fish, and the meat was of the true trout color,
too.”</p>

<p>“I think we can depend on taking many a fine
mess of them from now on,” Dick continued,
“though we must try to find out from the Indians
just where they lurk in the river. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
one of these smaller creeks, that empty into
the Missouri, may turn out to be a good place.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow will be our chance then,” Roger
announced, “because I heard Captain Clark tell
some of the men we would likely hold over for a
day, so as to mend one of the boats that has been
leaking badly and needs attention.”</p>

<p>“Let us consider it settled that way, then,
Roger; and we shall see what sort of luck the
best of bait will fetch us. In some of the old
stumps and dead wood we can find big, fat
grubs, which I am sure the fish will take to savagely.”</p>

<p>“I mean to start looking for bait this very
evening when we make camp,” declared Roger,
evincing the greatest interest, for the memory
of the feast they had enjoyed when that splendid
speckled fish was broiled over the red coals
had haunted him ever since.</p>

<p>That afternoon the air was unusually clear,
and every one was able to see, off in the distance,
the lofty peaks of the mountain barrier
which must be scaled by the adventurous travelers
before they could hope to reach the slopes,
on the west, leading down to the blue waters of
the Pacific. Somehow the knowledge that on
this summer day they had almost arrived at another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
positive stage of their great undertaking
inspired their hearts with fresh hope. And in
that cheering atmosphere camp was made when
the shadows began to fall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>ON FISHING BENT</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">If</span> you think you can get on without me,
Dick, I’d like to slip away for a little time,”
Roger was saying, after the boats had been run
ashore, the horses tethered among the trees, and
preparations for supper, with an attendant air
of bustle, were well underway.</p>

<p>Of course Dick knew what was in the wind.
He had not forgotten the remark made by his
comrade that, if the chances were favorable, he
meant to spend half an hour or so that evening
collecting worms and grubs to be used as bait
when they tried their luck at fishing on the next
day.</p>

<p>“To be sure I can,” he told Roger, with a
smile. “All you have to do is to trot along with
your hatchet, and something to put the grubs in—if
you find any.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m not afraid of being left in the lurch
there,” asserted Roger, stoutly. “I can see
plenty of signs of dead wood around here. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
fierce storm must have swept across this section
many years ago, that leveled plenty of big
trees, which are now rotting on the ground.
Grubs like to hide in that sort of decayed stuff.
Look for me by the time it gets dusk.”</p>

<p>“Keep your gun near you, and it would be
better not to stray too far away from the camp,”
warned cautious Dick, speaking on general
principles.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe there’s any danger lurking
near by, do you?” asked Roger, though failing
to show much concern, for his nature was
daring and fearless.</p>

<p>“Nothing more than we always count on,” the
other told him. “But white men who are in a
strange country must always figure on finding
an enemy hiding back of some tree or rock, so
keep your eyes about you, Roger. If I should
hear your gun sound, or catch a hullo, depend on
me to come in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Roger only laughed, for he did not believe any
peril could lurk so close to the camp. Still, accustomed
to being on his guard, he made it a
point to see that the powder was in the pan as
he tucked his gun under his arm and strode
forth.</p>

<p>He found to his relief that there were plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of old stumps and rotting logs close to where the
fires had been started, so that he need not go
any great distance away in order to begin his
search.</p>

<p>His hatchet was soon brought into play, as he
smashed some of the likely looking remnants of
once proud forest monarchs. It required little
muscular effort, scattering the soft punk-like
wood, and, hardly had the boy obtained a fair
start, than with a satisfied little cry he reached
down and seized an enormous white grub whose
home in the heart of the decayed stump he had
broken open.</p>

<p>Just as Roger had anticipated, a rich harvest
awaited him. Sometimes he came upon half a
dozen prizes in one stump, and it was not long
before he knew that, before the darkness became
too dense for him to see how to work, he would
have secured all the bait they could possibly use
on the following morning.</p>

<p>At any rate, they would always have their
hatchets with them, and, should their supply run
low, there would be plenty of other opportunities
to replenish their store.</p>

<p>So it was that he returned to camp much
sooner than Dick in his most sanguine moments
had imagined possible. There was hardly any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
need to ask Roger how his quest had turned out,
for the broad smile on his tanned face told the
story.</p>

<p>“A noble lot of fish lure,” assented Dick,
when he had examined the contents of the small
box into which Roger had also cast a handful of
powdered dead wood, in which his prisoners
could conceal themselves. “I must say you
struck it rich this time.”</p>

<p>“And, unless the weather goes against us
when morning comes,” continued Roger, as he
fastened up the box so that nothing could get at
the bait during the night, “we ought to do some
tall fishing, it strikes me. I’d just like to give
the whole camp a splendid treat to those beauties
of speckled rainbow fish which we believe to
be a species of trout.”</p>

<p>All evening long the subject was frequently in
his mind, for Roger was one of those persistent
persons who, once they have planned anything,
can think of little else.</p>

<p>“I tell you what I mean to do after we’ve had
our breakfast,” he said at one time during the
evening.</p>

<p>“All right,” remarked Dick, who knew how
useless it was to try to keep Roger’s mind off
his fishing, “suppose you do then, and I’ll jot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
it down in my notebook, for I’m making up my
day’s log, you see. Go on and tell me.”</p>

<p>“If you look over there, Dick, you can see that
friendly Indian who has insisted on sticking to
us for two days now, walking along the shore,
squatting close to our fires, and watching everything
we do as though he was head over heels
in love with the ways of the palefaces.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve often wondered what he could be
thinking about,” admitted Dick. “I’ve seen
Captain Lewis trying to talk with him by signs,
and often calling one of the men up to help out.
From that I judged the Indian might be giving
him some valuable information, which was why
they allow him to tag after us so long, and even
see that he gets his share of food at meal times.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Roger, “my idea is to go
over to him now, and see if he can understand
that we’d like to have him tell us about a good
place for fishing in the morning; for, after all,
what’s the use of waiting until breakfast time;
he might be gone in the night. What do you
say to it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“Not a bad scheme,” his chum assented.
“And, do you know, I think the brave has taken
some little interest in both of us, because a number
of times it seemed to me he was watching us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
closely. There’s your chance now, for that matter,
Roger; and, if you find it too hard to make
him understand, get Jasper Williams, our good
friend, to act as interpreter for you.”</p>

<p>Upon that the impulsive Roger scrambled to
his feet and presently he could be seen sitting
close to the friendly Indian brave, engaging him
in a strange conversation in which hands and
smiles took the place of words.</p>

<p>Apparently, Roger finally found the task
greater than he could manage, for he called to
genial Jasper Williams, who joined them. Then
the business of explaining to the dusky son of
the wilderness was taken up anew; and with
fair success, if the look on Roger’s boyish face
meant anything.</p>

<p>When he once more rejoined his chum he was
fairly bubbling over with enthusiasm, so that
Dick was not at all surprised to hear him exclaim:</p>

<p>“The finest of luck ever, Dick! Would you
believe it? that brave tells us there is a small
stream emptying into the Missouri a couple of
miles above the camp, and that it is reckoned the
best place for those big fat trout around this
section of the country.”</p>

<p>“That is good news, indeed,” remarked Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
also pleased. “So we can look forward to supplying
the camp with a mess of fish, if all goes
well.”</p>

<p>“Not only did he tell us that,” continued the
eager lad, “but he agreed to go along with us,
and show where the best holes lie; for in hot
weather, you know, all trout leave the shallows
and gather in the deep, dark pools. If we
didn’t know just where those places were we
might waste a lot of time trying.”</p>

<p>At the time Dick thought they were very fortunate
to be able to command the services of the
friendly Indian, and he mentioned this belief to
Roger.</p>

<p>“He seems to have taken a great fancy to the
whites, and, no matter if he does eat like a hungry
dog, we must not complain. He will hardly
wish to go much further from his own people,
and we may expect to wake up some fine morning
to find that the brave has slipped off during
the night.”</p>

<p>“So long as he does not steal one of our
horses or guns nobody will complain, I guess,”
chuckled Roger. “These Indians are a light-fingered
set, take them all in all, and Jasper Williams
says he never would trust one out of his
sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Having made all their fishing arrangements
the boys soon afterwards sought their shelter
made from branches, and wrapped in their
blankets tried to find sleep.</p>

<p>The camp was governed with military strictness,
and there were sentries on duty all through
the night, for Captain Clark had this part of the
arrangements in charge. Not once up to this
time had they been taken by surprise, though on
several occasions roving bands of Blackfeet or
Dacotahs had tried to steal their horses, only to
meet with failure.</p>

<p>Securely guarded in this manner, they passed
the night in peace, and so another dawn found
them. As usual the travelers were early astir,
for there were no laggards among them. Every
man had his duties to perform, and strict discipline
kept them to their various tasks.</p>

<p>Roger of course was about the first one up,
though he knew that Dick could not be coaxed to
make a start until he had performed every one
of his duties as was his custom. If the fish were
as plentiful as the friendly Indian had declared,
they would have abundance of time to take
heavy toll of their number long before noon
came around.</p>

<p>“We decided to take one of the smaller boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
if it could be spared, you remember, Dick,”
Roger was saying as they ate breakfast.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the other replied, “and I’ve already
mentioned that to Captain Clark, who gave me
full permission to do so. This is certainly one
of the times we would enjoy having that buffalo-hide
Indian boat we shot the rapids in.
I was beginning to think we ought to change
our minds about giving it away, when that
accident happened, and ruined it for hard
work.”</p>

<p>“Accident!” echoed Roger. “We knew different
after we found where that sharp knife-blade
had been run along the bottom almost
through the tough hide. But that sly dog of an
Andrew Waller paid dearly for his work. I
wonder what became of him; whether he joined
the French trader and his son, or went over to
the Indians.”</p>

<p>“We may never know,” his chum admitted.
“For my part, I hope and trust that neither of
us will ever set eyes on Waller again. I did not
like the look he gave us when he went out of
camp that day; and, like all guilty wretches
caught in the act of doing wrong, he blames us
for his troubles.”</p>

<p>In good time Dick announced that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
ready to make the start. Roger saw to it that
they had the bait. Stout poles had also been secured,
to the end of which the fishing lines were
fastened. Such things as reels those pioneer
lads never knew. When a prize was hooked it
was their business to land the captive in the
speediest way possible; and, as a rule, this consisted
in swinging the struggling trout over
their heads on to the land.</p>

<p>The Indian was hovering nearby. Dick
fancied that he looked very eager, as though he
quite enjoyed the idea of accompanying the pair
on their fishing trip, and making himself useful.
Perhaps, the boy thought, the poor fellow
wished to attach himself to the expedition, on account
of the charm it had for his untutored
mind; for Indians could feel the desire for adventure
such as urged these bold white men to
penetrate farther day by day into the unknown
country.</p>

<p>The boys picked out the boat best adapted to
their needs, and which could be most easily
spared. Beckoning to the Indian, the boys prepared
to push out on the river. Two paddles
were to be the means of urging the light craft
against the strong current of the river, and an
hour’s time would be ample to see them to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
destination, Roger thought, as he commenced to
wield the spruce blade vigorously.</p>

<p>Jasper Williams called out a last word of
caution as they passed away, up the stream, for
he felt a strong interest in these boys with whose
fortunes he had been so intimately connected.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes about you, lads,” was what
he told them, “and don’t trust everything you
see, just because it looks innocent. There’s a
difference between red and white, remember.
Good luck to you both!”</p>

<p>Others also called out, begging the boys to remember
that they too liked a mess of fresh fish;
and, with these friendly voices ringing in their
ears, Dick and Roger paddled swiftly up the
river, soon losing sight of the explorer’s camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>GLORIOUS SPORT WITH THE TROUT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> lusty strokes the two boys urged the
boat up-stream. The Indian sat amidship and
seemed to be scanning the shore as though
deeply interested in everything he saw; though,
from what he told Jasper Williams, the locality
must have been familiar to him, since he knew
all about the fishing to be had in the smaller
stream.</p>

<p>Now and then the boys exchanged a few
words, though as a rule they kept most of their
“wind,” as Roger called it, for their arduous
work.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Jasper Williams meant,” remarked
Roger, after they had gone possibly a
full mile.</p>

<p>“Of course you mean when he said there was
a difference between red and white,” Dick suggested.
“I was thinking of the same thing myself,
and came to the conclusion it must have
been Jasper’s way of telling us to keep an eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
on our dusky pilot here. In plain words, he
warned us to look out for our guns.”</p>

<p>“Which we will certainly be sure to do!” commented
Roger. “Though, after all, we may
be wronging the poor Indian by our suspicions.”</p>

<p>“If he never knows it there can be no harm
done, don’t you see?” Dick told him.</p>

<p>Various things about the shore attracted their
attention just then, and for the time being they
forgot all about the red man, and the warning
given by their old frontiersman friend, Jasper
Williams.</p>

<p>“The farther we go up the river,” Dick was
saying, “the greater the forests seem to become.
From all I’ve been able to learn, we will pass
through many a stretch of wood before we reach
the foot of the big mountains.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, “and, as the river is
getting more and more shallow every day, Captain
Lewis seems to believe we must soon abandon
our boats, and take to the horses for the rest
of the journey.”</p>

<p>“Look up ahead and on the left, you will see
signs of a stream coming into the Missouri.
That must be where we are to stop.”</p>

<p>At that Dick made gestures to the Indian, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
quickly comprehending what was wanted,
nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“Yes, he says that is the place,” Roger observed,
as he started to put still a little more vim
into his strokes with the paddle, so, as Dick was
compelled to follow suit, or have the boat headed
in toward the shore, their progress increased to
a wonderful degree.</p>

<p>In good time they reached the mouth of the
tributary stream. It was found to be as clear
and cold as any one could wish on a warm day.
No wonder, Roger thought, the trout loved to
frequent its waters, and lie in the deep, dark
pools that doubtless existed here and there,
though without a guide they could have been
found only after much patient searching.</p>

<p>Obeying the gestures of the Indian, they made
for the shore and left the boat, first making sure
that it was pulled well up. Of course, besides
their poles and the little box of bait, they carried
their faithful guns along with them.</p>

<p>So far as they could see, the friendly Indian
seemed to be almost as deeply interested in the
outcome of the fishing trip as the boys themselves
were. He immediately led them to a certain
spot on the bank, holding up a hand to impress
upon them the need of caution and silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
when attempting to catch the wary fish of many
colors.</p>

<p>Roger was already prepared, for he had fastened
one of the largest and most attractive
grubs to his hook. Creeping up close to the
edge of the bank he thrust his long pole carefully
forward, and allowed the baited hook, with
a small lead sinker attached to the line a foot
above, to sink into the depths.</p>

<p>As it slowly descended Roger’s heart was
beating tumultuously, for he had been entertaining
high hopes. These were not doomed to disappointment,
for, even before he found bottom,
there was a sudden vicious tug, and the end of
the stout pole began to move up and down vigorously.</p>

<p>Immediately Roger, who had laid his gun
down at his feet so as to have the free use of
both hands, hunched his shoulders in the effort
to lift his prize. As it came struggling out of
the water, he switched it high in the air and it
fell with a thud some little distance behind the
excited fisherman. At this good luck Roger
could hardly contain himself.</p>

<p>A warning “hist” from Dick told him to repress
the shout of triumph that was bubbling to
his lips, and he realized the necessity for silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
if they expected to continue the sport, as the
trout are easily alarmed.</p>

<p>The capture proved to be a magnificent specimen
of the lovely variety of trout that differed
from anything either of the boys had ever seen
before. In later years this vigorous species of
fighter was classified, and given the deserved
name of “rainbow trout,” and for a very good
reason, as any one who has ever seen one fresh
drawn from the water will admit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dick started in to try his luck, and
it certainly began to look as though the Indian
had told only the truth when he said the fish lay
in countless numbers in those deep shadowy
pools, for, just as had happened in Roger’s case,
there was a fierce pull on his pole, and Dick
found himself struggling with a captive that it
required all his powers to land successfully.</p>

<p>So the sport progressed, the friendly Indian
hovering near them and often, when the bites
came less frequently, leading the way to some
new spot on the bank, where another pool would
be found.</p>

<p>Always did they find these places inhabited by
a hungry family of trout, eager to snap at the
attractive lure which was dangled in front of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indian gathered up the spoils as they
went along. He knew just how to fashion a
tether out of tough but yielding willow, and,
when half a dozen of the trout had been strung
in this manner, he saw to it that they were placed
in the water to keep fresh, while the sport continued
as before.</p>

<p>Roger was enjoying himself as he had hardly
ever done before. Such royal fishing, and such
game fighters made a combination that ought to
have been sufficient to fill any boy’s heart with
supreme joy, especially one so devoted to the
sport as Roger had always been.</p>

<p>Dick did not lose his head over the wonderful
success that was coming their way. Because
Roger gave himself up so wholly to the excitement
was a very good reason why Dick himself
should do the watching for both of them.</p>

<p>And yet it seemed almost absurd to suspect
that anything evil could be threatening them on
that bright summer morning. The very insects
seemed to hum more noisily than usual, as
though with the pleasure of living on such a perfect
day.</p>

<p>Dick often cast a side glance toward the Indian,
but so far he had seen absolutely nothing
suspicious in his manner. He seemed to be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
happy as Roger, and kept close to the heels of
the boy as he worked his long rod, and added
constantly to the number of fish he was taking.</p>

<p>It seemed as though each one of the grubs was
good for a fat trout, and so savagely did the fish
snap at them that they were securely hooked in
nearly every instance, so that the losses were
next to nothing.</p>

<p>If things continued to go on as they were doing,
they would soon be in possession of all the
fish the camp could use. Roger even told his
chum in a whisper that, unless they looked out,
they would be unable to carry the whole of their
taking back in one trip of the boat, though possibly
that was only meant in the light of a boast.</p>

<p>Dick’s arms were beginning to ache on account
of the strain on the muscles caused by raising so
many heavy prizes over his head. He would
have suggested that they had quite a large mess
now, and perhaps had better go back to camp,
allowing some of the others the pleasure of coming
up later and trying their luck; but he knew
Roger well enough to feel sure that the other
would decline to quit fishing as long as a single
grub remained.</p>

<p>At any rate, when the supply was really exhausted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Dick meant to decline to linger any
longer, or to look for a new lot of bait.</p>

<p>For the moment the fish seemed to have
stopped biting.</p>

<p>“We have only about six more grubs left,
Dick,” said Roger, after examining the contents
of the bait box, “and that ought to mean as
many fish, if the Indian guide knows of still another
good hole. I’m going to try to ask him.
And, Dick, I promise you on my word of honor
that I’ll agree to quit when we use up the last
bait. I can see that you’re getting tired. You
never were as crazy over the sport as I have always
been.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bargain then, Roger,” assented the
other, pleased to know that his comrade meant
to be reasonable about it, for he had half-expected
trouble in trying to tear the other away
from such a fascinating game.</p>

<p>Roger accordingly began to make motions to
the Indian, and the other must have understood
what he wanted, for he nodded his head, and
beckoned to them to follow where he led.</p>

<p>Dick would rather have remained where he
stood, but he did not wish to have Roger go off
alone with the Indian brave, so he went along.
He thought the copper-colored visitor at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
camp showed even more eagerness than at any
previous time in the immediate past, as though
he had been keeping the finest place of all to the
last, in order to further astonish them.</p>

<p>Indeed, when Dick saw Roger drag out a trout
that exceeded all the rest in size and fierceness
he decided that he had guessed the true reason
for that look he had detected on the usually emotionless
face of the brave.</p>

<p>Again did Roger drop his baited hook in, and
with a similar result. He was fairly trembling
with the excitement, and, too, a little weariness;
but according to his count there still remained
four more grubs, and the work must proceed.
As Dick seemed bent on letting him finish the
tale, Roger, nothing averse, set to work to get
his hook in readiness once more.</p>

<p>The spot was a picturesque one. Several
large trees grew close to the edge of the stream,
casting their shadows upon the water just where
the deep pool lay. In the dusky depth the trout
were lying, and hungry at that. Dick could not
remember of ever having seen such a combination
of scenery and splendid fishing grounds,
and he believed the memory of that day would
always be marked with a white stone in their
lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>It certainly was destined to be remembered,
but not on these accounts alone. There were
other reasons why the pioneer boys would look
back to that sunny day and conjure up ghosts of
the past.</p>

<p>Roger was making good his boast that he
meant to take six fish with those half dozen
grubs, for already a third one had been pulled
in.</p>

<p>The Indian, apparently just as deeply interested
in the sport as Roger himself, was
hanging at the boy’s elbow, and every now and
then making gestures as though showing him
where to drop his hook the next time. It seemed
as though his wonderful eyes were able to pierce
those dark depths and discover where the
largest fish was lazily working his fins, as he
faced the current, waiting for something suited
to his taste to come within striking distance.</p>

<p>There was nothing at all suspicious about this,
and Dick was beginning to believe the vague
fears that had oppressed him must have been the
result of too much imagination, when without
the slightest warning something happened.</p>

<p>He saw a dark object drop from the branches
of the tree directly upon the back and shoulders
of poor Roger, who was instantly carried to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
ground. Dick’s first inclination was to give a
shout, and raise his gun, for he had seen their
dusky guide pounce upon the weapon which
Roger had laid on the grass at his feet.</p>

<p>Before Dick could make a move, however, he
too felt a heavy weight strike him on the shoulders
so that he was knocked to his back; and, as
he lay there gasping for breath, he looked up
into the painted faces of several Indian warriors
who came dropping from the trees as though
they were over-ripe plums in a gale of wind.</p>

<p>After all, the supposed friendly Indian had
played them false, and had actually led the two
boys into a cleverly arranged ambuscade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>PRISONERS OF THE DACOTAHS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> knew the folly of resistance when he saw
that, besides the two warriors who held him
down, there were half a dozen others nearby.
Roger, always impulsive and headstrong, was
struggling desperately, though without the
slightest chance of breaking away from his captors.
Understanding what was taking place
close by, Dick called out:</p>

<p>“Give up, Roger; it is foolish to fight against
such odds. You will only be hurt for your
pains, and nothing gained. Leave it all to
me!”</p>

<p>Not only did Roger hear these words, but his
own good sense told him the wisdom of yielding
to overwhelming numbers. But it was always a
difficult thing for Roger to believe in the old
saying to the effect that “he who fights and runs
away may live to fight another day.”</p>

<p>After being disarmed the two boys were allowed
to get upon their feet. They discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that their dusky captors undoubtedly belonged
to the same tribe as their treacherous guide, and,
therefore, must be Dacotahs. That guide was
clutching Roger’s gun as though he expected to
retain it as the price of his labors in thus entering
the camp of the strange “palefaces,” and
luring the two boys into the trap so cunningly
contrived.</p>

<p>Dick was far from downcast. It took considerable
to make him feel as though everything
were dark around him. And, in order to cheer
Roger up, as well as to arouse his interest in
planning an escape, the first remark Dick made
was in the line of an attempt to guess how it had
all been planned.</p>

<p>“Look, they are marking a smoke now,” he
told his companion, as several of their captors
struck flint and steel together, and with the
spark thus generated started a fire in a little pile
of greenish-looking wood.</p>

<p>“That must be meant for a signal to some one
who is away from here,” Roger commented, on
observing what was going on. “Dick, what
does all this mean? You are always good at hitting
on the truth while I grope in the dark.
Why do you think these Indians want to make us
prisoners?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was a trap, you understand, Roger?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, that’s as plain as can be,” replied
the other, readily enough; “for they were all
hiding up in these trees while we kept on fishing
so merrily, without dreaming that we were being
watched every minute of the time.”</p>

<p>“And, Roger, the guide led us into the mess;
now we can understand why he was so eager to
fetch us up here.”</p>

<p>“Then you believe, do you, Dick, he planned
this thing; that perhaps he even entered our
camp with such a game in his mind?”</p>

<p>“It begins to look that way, I am sorry to
say,” Dick replied.</p>

<p>“But can he be in the pay of that revengeful
Frenchman, François Lascelles?” demanded
Roger, rather appalled by the thought.</p>

<p>“We will soon know, because, unless I am mistaken,
that smoke they are sending up yonder
is meant to call him here. And it would not surprise
me very much, Roger, if that brave who
has been eating at our campfire for two days,
crept out last night and told how he had been
engaged to take us to this stream to-day. That
would account for the Indians being concealed
here.”</p>

<p>The boys were without weapons, and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
do nothing toward the making of their escape;
so they waited with what patience they
could command to see what was about to happen.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards some one was seen approaching,
at sight of whom Roger gave utterance
to an exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>“Why, after all, it’s that skunk, Andrew Waller!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, he must have found some way to get in
with these Indians, and they have been working
for his interests,” Dick suggested. “Perhaps
he has lied to them, and made them believe we
are two very important persons. He may take
the trouble to explain the thing to us, thinking it
will add to his glory.”</p>

<p>“I can see the look of satisfaction on his face
from here,” said Roger, in a surly tone, as
though it cut him to the quick to have the traitor
triumph over them in that way.</p>

<p>Waller soon arrived on the scene, and his first
act was to look insolently into the faces of the
two boys.</p>

<p>“So, you fell to the bait, did you, boys?
When I told you we would meet again you didn’t
believe it would be so soon. And let me say that
you are going to be in a pretty pickle after this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
These Indians will make sure that you do not
slip through their hands.”</p>

<p>“What have you been telling them about us?”
demanded Roger, impetuously. “Some big lie I
am sure, for it would be just like you.”</p>

<p>The man frowned as though angry, and Dick
feared he was about to strike the bold boy a blow
in the face, which would have precipitated a fight
in which Roger would have gone down to defeat.
However, Waller managed to keep his temper in
control, and sneering again, went on to say:</p>

<p>“Oh! to make sure that you would be held a
close prisoner, I merely told them that you boys
were the sons of the Big White Father away off
in the Land of the Rising Sun; and that if they
held you safe they could demand a great ransom
in wampum, sticks-that-shoot-fire, and everything
that the heart of an Indian could wish. In
other words I have cooked your goose for you.
You may be sure you will never be allowed to go
free.”</p>

<p>He turned his back on them and commenced
talking with one of the Dacotahs, who, from the
feathers in his black hair, seemed to be some sort
of sub-chief. Much of the conversation was carried
on by gestures, in which Waller seemed to
be unusually expert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick watched closely in the hope that he might
be able to catch the drift of what was passing
between the two. That he and Roger were the
objects under consideration he had not the
slightest doubt, for several times one or the
other pointed toward the spot where they stood.</p>

<p>“Can you make it out at all, Dick?” Roger
asked.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say it’s more than I’ve been
able to understand, Roger; but I think he’s telling
the chief again how valuable we are as
prizes. And to think we have no way of proving
to him that we are only ordinary boys, without
rich fathers to pay a big ransom. It is just
the sort of game we might have expected Andrew
Waller to play.”</p>

<p>The man who had been sent out of the camp of
the explorers now approached them again. He
was rubbing his hands as though in great glee.</p>

<p>“Now, I shall not only have my pick of two
good guns, but plenty of ammunition for them,
in spite of Captain Lewis. I am going to say
good-by to you here, for I have to meet M’sieu
Lascelles at an appointed rendezvous. Oh! he
will be very much pleased when he learns how
the Dacotahs prize the boys he hates so bitterly,
and mean to carry them off to their villages, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to the north, there to keep them until the big
ransom arrives. It tickles me to know how soon
my debt to you has been so nicely cancelled.”</p>

<p>Roger gritted his teeth, but he managed to
keep from saying anything.</p>

<p>“Just as you told us when you were leaving
camp, we may meet again, Andrew Waller,”
Dick said, with an unmistakable meaning in his
voice.</p>

<p>“Oh! that is possible,” the other jauntily
added, purposely misunderstanding what the
boy meant; “for it may be M’sieu Lascelles,
he would wish to see for himself that you are
comfortable, so for that reason we might
journey into the Dacotah country ourselves.”</p>

<p>With that thrust he waved his hand to them,
and, turning, walked away as he had come.
None of the Indians paid the least heed to his
movements; but Roger almost choked in his indignation.</p>

<p>“Just to think, Dick,” he muttered in a
quivering voice, “the beast is carrying my dear
old gun which he took from our red guide, on his
shoulder. How much I will miss it, because,
ever since I’ve been able to look along the sights
of a rifle, that gun has been my companion day
and night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“We shall hope that in some way or other you
will see it again,” Dick told him. “Even if not,
there are others just as sure shooters at the
camp. The one he used to own, and which they
refused to let him carry off, is even a better-made
weapon than yours.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that gun has associations away
above its value in money,” said Roger, heaving
a sigh; “and at the best the chances of
my ever handling it again are three against
one.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must try to think of other things
now,” Dick told him.</p>

<p>“You mean about escaping from our captors,
don’t you, Dick? What if we can convince them
that Waller is a man with a double tongue, and
that what he told them about our being the sons
of the Great White Father at Washington is
only a package of lies?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can try, but I’m afraid it will
be useless, because the Indians want to believe
that wonderful story. See how all of them are
examining my gun now. I suppose every one
of them is picturing himself as owning just such
a marvelous weapon that ‘spits out fire,’ and
kills the game just as thunder and lightning do
in the storm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you think they expect to do with us
now?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“They will not want to stay here much
longer,” affirmed Dick, “because they are afraid
of the ‘palefaces with their thunder sticks.’
Consequently, they will start off toward their
village, which we understand lies several days’
journey away from here toward the northwest.”</p>

<p>“But, when we fail to come back to-day, Captain
Lewis is bound to send some of his best
trackers up here to learn what happened to us.
And, Dick, surely they will try to follow our
captors, and effect our rescue.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Roger. We must not leave it all to
them. These cunning red men know how to
cover a trail so that the keenest eye cannot find
a trace. Depend on it, they will leave no stone
unturned to hide the tracks we make. And then,
besides, do we not know that the summer is already
beginning to wane?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, all that is only too true, Dick.
Captain Lewis understands there is no time to
spare, with those terrible mountains yet to be
scaled, and also black deserts to cross, and all
before snow flies. I am much afraid he will decide
that the success of the whole undertaking
would be put in peril should he detach any of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
men to engage in a wild goose hunt for us.”</p>

<p>“We two have before this been in positions of
peril,” said Dick, firmly, with a flash in his eyes
that aroused new hope in the breast of his chum;
“and always, in times that are past, have we succeeded
in saving ourselves. So let us keep up
our spirits and watch constantly for a chance to
give these Indians the slip.”</p>

<p>“If we should find the opportunity,” said
Roger, immediately, “I hope we manage to get
hold of your gun, and our hatchets and knives.
To lose my good shooting-iron is bad enough,
but that knife, you know, has served me since I
was knee-high to a grasshopper. Promise me
you will do your level best to save our side-arms
if we find a way to escape, Dick!”</p>

<p>To this entreaty Dick assented. Indeed, he knew
well enough that it was their only policy to go
away armed rather than in a helpless condition.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards they were given to understand,
through grunts and gestures, that the
march was about to be taken up. With several
Indians stalking along in single file ahead, and
others bringing up the rear the two boys had to
turn their backs upon the “Big Muddy” and
start upon the long journey into the Northwest,
at the end of which lay the Dacotah village.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>WHEN STOUT HEARTS WERE NECESSARY</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">We</span> have covered a good many miles since
starting, Dick, and I hope they soon show signs
of stopping for the night.”</p>

<p>The afternoon was getting well along when
Roger made this remark to his cousin. His tone
had a vein of complaint in it, for, although
Roger could tramp through the woods all day
and feel it but little, he did not like being forced
to do the walking against his will.</p>

<p>Another thing that fretted the boy was the
fact that every furlong passed over carried them
further away from their friends of the expedition,
the only whites, saving the French traders,
within hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Dick had begun to notice this growing feeling
of irritation on the part of his comrade. He
himself could look trouble in the face without
flinching, and he now concluded it was time to
cheer up Roger’s drooping spirits.</p>

<p>“No question but that they intend to pull up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pretty soon, Roger,” he said, as he trudged
along close to the other’s elbow. “In fact, I’ve
noticed some of them looking about as if they
expected to reach a good camp-ground at any
minute. They were tired at the time they lay
in wait for us, and must have come a long way.”</p>

<p>“Of course you noticed, Dick, that two of the
braves stayed behind when we left the river,
though they did catch up with us several hours
afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it is not difficult to guess what their
part in the retreat was,” replied Dick. “They
remained to conceal every trace of moccasined
feet, so that it would have to be a mighty good
tracker who could tell what had happened there
on the bank of the small stream.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and of course they’ve blinded our trail
in the bargain every now and then on the way,”
continued Roger, ruefully. “Three separate
times did we walk for half a mile in shallow
water, and leave the creek on the stones, so there
would be no sign left after the sun and wind
dried the wet marks. It was the old Indian
trick that we know so well.”</p>

<p>“I tried my best to leave a plain track,” added
Dick, “but the braves coming behind must have
seen me do it, and made sure to cover it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you believe Captain Lewis will do
about it?” asked Roger, he himself having
pondered on this subject without coming to a
conclusion.</p>

<p>“When we fail to return to the camp of course
they will send some of the men up to look the
ground over,” Dick answered, thoughtfully.
“The disappearance of the friendly Indian will
give them a clew. Then they are apt to find
some of the trout that were left behind fastened
to the willow withes.”</p>

<p>“I hope they enjoy them,” muttered Roger,
with a grimace, for he could not help remembering
how his mouth had fairly watered with anticipation
of the treat he had expected to have
that evening.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering, myself, how it came
that the Indians overlooked taking the fish,”
continued Dick, “and the only thing I can see is
that they were so anxious to get on the move before
any of the white men came along with those
terrible ‘fire-shooting-sticks,’ that they forgot
about it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Roger added, “and that treacherous
chap who guided us into the trap was so taken
up looking over your gun, which Waller had
turned over to him, that he forgot all about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
fish, too. Well, I hope they are found, and will
make a fine supper for the men.”</p>

<p>“It has clouded up, and looks a little as if we
might have a storm of some kind before morning
breaks,” went on Dick.</p>

<p>“More trouble if that happens,” grumbled the
other, glancing up at the heavens to verify his
comrade’s statement.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that,” Dick told him.
“It may turn out to be a great help to us, for all
we know, and give us a chance to make our escape.”</p>

<p>“What, do you think that, after all, some of
the trailers among our friends will be able to follow
us, and take these Indians by surprise?”
asked Roger.</p>

<p>Dick, however, shook his head at this.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Roger,” he observed,
“I’m afraid we can count on no such help from
our friends, even if they could discover our trail,
which is much in doubt.”</p>

<p>“But why not?” demanded the other. “Captain
Lewis thinks a lot of us, and he is hardly the
man to desert a friend, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Every word of that is true,” his chum assured
him. “There never could be a finer man
than Captain Lewis; but stop and think, Roger;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he is not on business of his own now, but bent on
carrying out a great exploring expedition that
was sanctioned by Congress, and backed by
President Jefferson himself. Every day counts
in the spelling of success; a delay here might
ruin all their plans.”</p>

<p>Roger nodded his head, as though he grasped
the idea.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can see what you mean, Dick,” he admitted,
slowly and regretfully, “and I guess you
are right. Much as Captain Lewis himself
might want to lay over and send a party of his
men out in search of us, his duty binds him the
other way. He will have to go on, and leave us
to our fate.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have been able to take care of ourselves
lots of times before now, Roger, and why
not again?”</p>

<p>Somehow his last words seemed to arouse
the dormant spirit of confidence in the other.
Roger gritted his teeth, while his eyes flashed defiantly.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Dick, we have done plenty of
things before, and can again,” he declared with
a ring in his voice that Dick liked to hear.
“Our fathers never showed the white feather
when they faced troubles just as bad, and why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
should we? How many times have we listened
to them tell how they followed that band of Iroquois
Indians ever so far into the North, and
rescued their sister Kate, who had been carried
away.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I’m done with repining, Dick; from
now on you’ll find me different.”</p>

<p>“Then to-night, when we are in camp, we must
try to outwit these red rascals. Even now I
have something of a plan in my mind. And you
may be sure that every mile we covered I kept
tally of the direction, so I know just how to go
in order to reach the Missouri again.”</p>

<p>“You shame me, Dick,” frankly admitted
the other boy; “to know that, while I’ve been
fretting and complaining, thinking only of
our troubles, you were keeping track of
such things as would help us get back to our
friends.”</p>

<p>A little later on, Dick, who seemed to keep his
eyes constantly on the alert, once more spoke to
his comrade.</p>

<p>“There’s something brewing, as sure as you
live, Roger,” he said; “for the Indians are consulting
together in hushed tones, and examining
the ground as if they had run across some tracks
there that excited them.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>“Can it be game, and they are being tempted
to start on a hunt?” asked Roger.</p>

<p>“Two-footed game, then,” replied the other
boy, “for I can see there are moccasin tracks all
around. Of course, as the different tribes make
moccasins after their tribal way, it’s easy for
these Dacotahs to know the others are not of
their kind.”</p>

<p>“They certainly do act as if they suspected
there might be a breath of danger hanging
around, Dick. Do you know whether the Sioux
and the Dacotahs are enemies or not?”</p>

<p>“They have been in the past,” acknowledged
Dick; “but I know the print of a Sioux moccasin,
and these are different, Roger.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Shoshones. You remember Captain
Lewis told us we were likely to run upon
some of that warlike tribe at any time now.
Yes, and he remarked that, as a rule, they were
enemies to the Blackfeet, Crows, Flat Heads,
Dacotahs, and nearly every other tribe up in the
Northwest.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised if you have hit on
the truth, Roger, and that this war party turns
out to be fierce Shoshones. Our good friend,
Captain Lewis, said he hoped to make friends
of them, since we must pass through their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
country before striking the great mountains.”</p>

<p>“There, we are going on again, Dick, but notice
how the braves keep looking to the right and
to the left, as if they feared an ambush. The
Shoshones must be a fierce lot of fighters, or else
be in overpowering numbers.”</p>

<p>“I think, if I can read an Indian’s mind,” said
Dick presently, “these braves will make an early
camp. If they start a fire at all it will be only a
small one without smoke, and hidden in a hole,
so that its light will not betray them.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s a poor chance for supper, I
take it,” grumbled Roger, who, having a
splendid appetite, did not fancy going hungry,
or chewing on a tough piece of pemmican, or
jerked venison.</p>

<p>“You often complain of things being dull,
Roger; but I am sure you must admit there’s no
lack of excitement for us now. We are prisoners
in the hands of the hostile Indians; there
is a storm threatening; and now comes a chance
that, before morning, the camp may be attacked
by these Shoshones who are out looking for
plunder and scalps.”</p>

<p>“If they should come, Dick, what do you suppose
would happen to us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger felt rather anxious, for he had heard it
said that among Indians it was the custom to kill
their prisoners rather than have them rescued,
or taken away by a rival tribe.</p>

<p>“If I can carry out my plans,” Dick assured
him, “I don’t mean to wait until the camp is attacked.
I’d like to be miles on the way back to
the river before that comes to pass, if it really
does.”</p>

<p>“There, I think we are going to pull up at
last,” ventured Roger, as he saw the leading Indians
halt, and begin to look around as though to
make sure that no enemy lurked in the neighboring
woods.</p>

<p>It was a well-chosen spot for a concealed
camp. A shallow depression, very like a large
bowl, offered them a chance to build a small fire
without any risk of the blaze being seen; and, so
far as smoke was concerned, those dusky sons of
the forest could be counted on to select such
wood that there would not be sent up the slightest
column of vapor to betray them.</p>

<p>Roger, still watching, soon uttered a low cry
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“See, Dick, they do mean to have a little cooking-fire!”
he exclaimed; “and that means we
may get some supper after all. So far they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
have shown us no particular ill will, and treated
us half-way decently.”</p>

<p>“That comes of being taken for the sons of the
Great White Father at Washington,” remarked
Dick, with a chuckle that told that his spirits had
not been crushed even though the future looked
so dark and forbidding. “It is a high honor
that has come to us, Roger, to be reckoned President
Jefferson’s own boys!”</p>

<p>Roger, however, was more interested in what
was going on about the little fire than anything
else. He observed just how the expert braves
formed a small pyramid, and then used the flint
and steel to start a tiny blaze.</p>

<p>“Yes, one of them is unwrapping that bundle
he carries, Dick,” the boy went on to say, “and,
just as I expected, it contains some freshly
killed venison. Oh! it’s going to be all right,
and we are due for some supper, I reckon.”</p>

<p>But Dick was thinking of other things than
eating just then. He surveyed with a critical
eye the lowering sky, and wondered if a storm
was about to break upon them before morning
came.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two prisoners had been made to sit down,
and were under constant surveillance. It would
not have been possible for them to make any
move looking to escape without being immediately
detected. Dick realized the foolishness
of such an attempt, and made no effort for the
time being.</p>

<p>Those eyes of his noted everything that was
going on around him, for he knew the time was
approaching when utter darkness would come,
and, if they expected to make a move, memory
must take the place of sight.</p>

<p>Just as Roger had been hoping, the Indians
cooked some of the venison, though in a primitive
fashion. Numerous pieces, as they were
sliced from the haunch, were impaled on the
ends of long slivers of wood, and the latter
thrust into the earth in such fashion that the
meat received the full heat of the little fire.</p>

<p>Of course, when cooked it was also partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
burned, but this made no difference to any one
who was really hungry. The two boys were
glad to receive their share of the venison, and
devoured it eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course they’ll tie us up, as Indians always
do their prisoners, Dick?” suggested
Roger, while they were still munching at the
food provided by their captors.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about that,” the other
told him. “Already I have noticed one of the
warriors looking over some long deerskin
thongs, and then glancing in our direction. I
think they are only waiting until we get through
eating.”</p>

<p>“Then for one I mean to keep at it as long as
I can,” affirmed Roger; “because I never did
like the idea of being tied to a tree. I suppose
that is what they mean to do with us, Dick.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know, Roger, and, now that I
have the chance, I want to tell you about the
little scheme I have in my mind.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would!” hastily exclaimed the
other; “and I hope it will turn out to be a success.”</p>

<p>“You may remember,” began Dick, “that I
have hands that somehow I can double up into
a very small compass. Many a time you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
tried to fasten my wrists together to see if I
could get my hands free, and in nearly every
case I did the trick by stretching the thongs a
little, and then slipping a hand out.”</p>

<p>“Oh! now I begin to see what you hope to do,
Dick; and, let me tell you, the skies look brighter
already. I’m sure you can set your hands free,
if only it doesn’t stop at that.”</p>

<p>“One step at a time, Roger; we mustn’t expect
to run before we can walk. Once my hands
are loose, it will be a queer thing if in some way
I fail to set both of us free. But here comes
several of the Indians this way, as though they
mean to trice us up. Better hurry and eat that
last bit of meat, if you wouldn’t lose it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’d better,” grumbled Roger, “but
I don’t see why they want to be in such a dreadful
hurry about tying us up. Ugh! a whole
night of standing against a tree is something I
don’t like at all.”</p>

<p>It turned out just as Dick had said, for the Indians
indicated by signs that they wished the
two boys to stand up and back against a couple
of trees that happened to grow close together.</p>

<p>From the way in which the deerskin thongs
were used to tie the captives to the trees it was
evident that the braves had had long practice at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
this art. When they had used up all the hide
rope, Dick and Roger were indeed in a helpless
position, being bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>“This is about as hard as anything we ever
went through, Dick,” remarked Roger, after the
Indians had finished their task and left them
there.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is very true, Roger, but I want to
tell you that I can move one of my hands, and
I’m starting to stretch this buckskin thong.
After a short time I believe I can get my hands
free.”</p>

<p>“That’s good news; and what next, Dick?”</p>

<p>“If only that brave doesn’t happen to remember
that he stuck his knife into my tree right
here, and return to possess himself of it, why,
don’t you see how fortunate that is going to turn
out for us?”</p>

<p>“A knife so close to your hands once you get
them free—that would be simply glorious, Dick.
And I’m going to keep hoping that warrior has
no need for his blade during the whole night.”</p>

<p>“I believe I can reach it,” continued Dick,
twisting his head around to take another look at
the coveted weapon; “and if I do, one slash will
cut this buckskin rope. After that, you can depend
on me to jump over to your side. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
keep on working your hands all you can, Roger,
for the looser your bonds are the better in the
end.”</p>

<p>The night was by now closing in around them.</p>

<p>Some time before the fire had been carefully
extinguished, water being thrown on the burning
embers to hasten its end. Dick, still watching
the actions of the Indians, soon saw they
were taking extra precautions against a surprise.
From all of the signs the boys concluded
that these Dacotahs had good reason to fear the
coming of the hostile war party.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an idea,” he told Roger in following
out this train of thought, “that not so very long
back the Dacotahs must have made a raid on the
lodges of the Shoshone tribe, and done more or
less damage. Somehow they act to me as if
guilty.”</p>

<p>“And, Dick, if ever the two parties do clash,
there will be a lively time of it, we can be sure,”
Roger in turn remarked. “These braves seem
to be a picked lot, as far as I can tell, and ought
to put up a good fight, even if outnumbered.”</p>

<p>“While I’ve never watched a real battle between
two war parties of Indians,” observed
Dick, “I must say I’m not dying with curiosity
to see one. I only hope we have a chance to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
away from here before it happens. And, Roger,
another thing—I’m keeping an eye on that fellow
who is carrying my gun. He has placed it,
together with the powder-horn and bullet-pouch,
on that log yonder, you notice.”</p>

<p>“Now it is queer that I hadn’t noticed such a
thing, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Simply because you waste so much time
bothering about our hard luck, when you might
just as well be using eyes and ears to learn something
worth while,” the other boy told him.
“Now, if only I can manage to snatch up my gun
and other fixings when we leave here, it will
make me happy, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>The minutes dragged along slowly to the two
boys. When an hour, and then two, had passed,
Roger was beginning to complain again, for it
was weary work being forced to stand in this
way upon their feet.</p>

<p>By this time the Indians had ceased their low
droning talk. Only one of them was still sitting
there cross-legged, smoking his red clay pipe.
Dick did not doubt that somewhere in the gloom
one or two sentries, or videttes, had been posted,
in order to guard against a surprise in every
way possible, though of course he could not see
the first sign of their presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the customary sounds of a summer night
in the wilderness came to the ears of the captive
pioneer boys. Most of these were very familiar
to them, on account of their habit for years of
spending nights out of doors.</p>

<p>Still, somehow, things did not seem quite the
same as usual. It was different listening to the
hoot of the owl, the croak of the night heron, the
complaint of the tree-frog calling for more rain,
or even the barking of a red fox somewhere in
the forest, when tied up in this way, and facing
such a gloomy outlook.</p>

<p>“Dick,” whispered Roger, “isn’t it nearly
time?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied the other in the same cautious
manner, “hold your horses, and have patience,
Roger. Another hour or two must go by
before I dare start in.”</p>

<p>Poor impatient Roger groaned, and relapsed
into silence again. Oh! how time did drag
along. It seemed to the boy he would go fairly
wild, waiting for something to break that terrible
monotony.</p>

<p>There were no stars overhead by means of
which they could tell how the night was wearing
on. Dick had to resort to other means by which
to mark the passage of time; still he knew fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
well when the hour of midnight approached.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Roger had finally fallen asleep, uncomfortable
as his position was. Dick could
just manage to see, by straining his eyes, that
his chum’s head had fallen forward upon his
chest, as though tired Nature had overcome
him.</p>

<p>Dick concluded that there was no use waiting
any longer to put his plan into operation.
Everything about the camp seemed silent, and,
although he took a desperate chance, the boy
believed he would gain nothing by further delay.</p>

<p>His initial act was to draw first one hand and
then the other from the stretched buckskin
thongs. Then turning as best he could he
reached out toward the knife the Indian who had
helped tie them to the tree had left sticking
there, even with the boy’s head.</p>

<p>What a thrill passed through Dick’s whole
frame as his eager hand touched that welcome
blade. Its buckhorn handle, too, felt very
familiar, and he was almost sure it would turn
out to be the hunting-knife Roger valued so
highly because of the associations connected
with it.</p>

<p>As it possessed a keen edge, he found no difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in bending down and severing his bonds.
After that he stopped and listened, but there
was nothing to indicate that his actions had
been discovered. The owl had commenced his
mournful hooting again; and the tree-frog piped
up louder than ever, Dick noticed with considerable
satisfaction, for he hoped the sounds would
muffle any slight noise he would chance to make.</p>

<p>Now he turned to set Roger free. He hoped
in his heart that, upon being aroused, Roger
would not utter an exclamation. With this possibility
in mind Dick very cautiously crept over
to the other tree.</p>

<p>He could hear Roger’s heavy breathing, showing
that the boy still slept. With great care
Dick raised himself until he could put his lips
close to the other’s ear, when he whispered:</p>

<p>“Roger, wake up, but keep very still! I am
going to cut your bonds now!”</p>

<p>The boy gave a great start, but fortunately he
did not attempt to answer. He comprehended
instantly what the situation was, and knew the
necessity for silence.</p>

<p>Already Dick’s hands were seeking for the
deerskin thongs that bound the wrists of his
comrade to the tree. As soon as he had made
certain, the pressure of the sharp blade instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
severed the restraining cords and set Roger’s
hands free.</p>

<p>All that remained now was to do the same
service with regard to the hide rope that went
around Roger’s waist, and then around his
ankles further down. After that they could
listen for a minute, to make sure they had not
been heard, and then depart from the hostile
camp on hands and knees, creeping stealthily
along like a couple of snakes.</p>

<p>So far Dick’s cleverly arranged plan had
worked admirably. If the rest proved to be as
easy of accomplishment they could congratulate
themselves on having done a big thing, with
credit to their education in the line of border
cunning.</p>

<p>Dick had just finished severing the last of the
bonds, and Roger was in the act of stepping
forward, when something suddenly occurred
that thrilled both boys to the heart, as well as
put a different aspect on their method of hasty
departure.</p>

<p>From some place back in the woods a little
way a loud and singular whoop rang forth.
Dick believed that it must be intended as a signal
announcing an attack; for, hardly had it ceased
to ring through the aisles of the forest, than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
deafening chorus of wild yells rang forth, together
with the rush of many bodies crashing
through the underwood and advancing from
every direction toward the camp of the Dacotahs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>SHELTER IN A HOLLOW TREE</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">It</span> is the Shoshone war-cry!” exclaimed
Roger, instinctively, as he heard the piercing,
bubbling sound that must have been uttered with
a hand to the mouth.</p>

<p>Dick seized hold of his chum. He realized
that any delay now might prove very costly
for them both.</p>

<p>“We must get away from here!” he cried,
thinking of what Roger had said concerning the
savage ways of the Indians, and how they often
preferred killing their prisoners to letting them
be set free, or taken by a hostile tribe.</p>

<p>“Your gun, Dick?” asked Roger, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I mean to make a grab for it,” replied the
other, who was already moving off.</p>

<p>Then it was that his careful survey of the surroundings
came into play, for Dick had made a
mental map upon which he could depend when
utter darkness lay upon the earth.</p>

<p>Roger, still hearkening to the dreadful sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that were bursting out all about them, felt his
companion duck down, and he judged that they
must be alongside the log on which the gun with
the ammunition had been placed by the Indian
who had led them into the trap.</p>

<p>And, somehow, Roger guessed that success
had come to his chum, even though he himself
could not see anything of the gun. Again he
was being half dragged along, as though Dick
had chosen his course, and was trying to follow
it.</p>

<p>Their one idea now was to get away from the
camp, and let the hostile red men have their
fight out to the bitter end. Small affair it was
of the boys whether the Dacotahs whipped the
Shoshones, or the latter overwhelmed the braves
who had been the captors of the young pioneers.</p>

<p>Skillful maneuvering was necessary in order
to avoid contact with any of the furious warriors.
The boys heard the sound of blows being
struck, and their lively imaginations could picture
what was occurring nearby, as they slipped
along through the darkness.</p>

<p>Fortune was kind to them, after all, for they
did not strike against a single dusky figure, although
several times they had to sink close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the ground when they heard the rush of moccasined
feet close at hand.</p>

<p>Now the noise of the desperate hand-to-hand
conflict was behind them, Roger noticed with a
feeling of great relief. He could hear not only
the war cries of those who fought, but occasionally
there also came sounds of darker import,
such as were probably the death chants of those
who were bound for the “happy hunting
grounds” of the red men. As they gradually
put all this horrible clamor further and further
behind them, the two boys felt their own spirits
rise higher. The attack of the Shoshones had
come just in the nick of time to help the young
pioneers. It had served to cover their escape
as nothing else could have done.</p>

<p>Roger was panting for breath, because of the
excitement as well as his strenuous actions. He
had knocked into more than one tree, but without
so far seriously hurting himself; and as
usual the boy felt that he must give tongue to the
feelings of wild delight that were rioting
through his veins.</p>

<p>“We did it, Dick, for a fact; gave them the
slip!” he burst forth.</p>

<p>“It looks that way, Roger.”</p>

<p>“And now all we have to do is to get our bearings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and make a fresh start for the river; isn’t
it?” continued Roger, anxiously.</p>

<p>“That’s all, Roger,” he was assured. “And
already I feel that we are on the right course,
so we’ll keep along as we’re going now.”</p>

<p>“But the fight seems to be over with,” added
Roger. “At any rate all the yells have stopped.
I wonder whether the Dacotahs whipped, or
were overpowered by their foes? Though for
that matter we care mighty little how it turned
out.”</p>

<p>“Since neither of them were our friends,”
Dick admitted, “we had no interest in the outcome
of the forest battle. It was a case of dog
eat dog with us; and I only hope we’ll run
across no more of the red rascals until we rejoin
our party.”</p>

<p>“How far do you mean to go before stopping,
Dick?”</p>

<p>Roger was getting a little tired when he asked
this question. They had both had a hard day
of it, beside the standing for several hours in
a cramped position tied to the trees.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to keep on for at least an
hour more,” Dick told him, “even if it does
pull hard. By then we’ll have reached a point
where the Indians who turn out to be victors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
can hardly find us in the morning, even if they
happen to bother making the search. So keep
up your spirits, Roger, for we’ve got a heap to
be thankful for.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of that, Dick, and I hope you
didn’t think I was complaining just now. You’ll
find me good for an hour’s tramp in the dark,
or two of them, for that matter. Then for a
few hours’ sleep before day breaks.”</p>

<p>“It may be the storm will swoop down on us
before then, and force us to change our plans.
So, after a while, we must keep a lookout for
some sort of shelter, such as a hollow tree. It
wouldn’t be the first time we have lain in such
a snug nook when the rain was coming down in
bucketfuls.”</p>

<p>“I should say it wasn’t!” declared Roger,
and from that time on he seemed to have picked
up a new supply of energy, for he uttered no
further complaint as he struggled on at the side
of his companion.</p>

<p>No matter how slowly the minutes passed,
Roger realized that the conditions were vastly
different from what they seemed earlier in the
night; when tied to that tree the gloom around
him was no thicker than the state of his feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick finally came to a halt. Perhaps the hour
had not fully passed, but he believed they had
put enough ground behind them to feel safe.
Besides, he had made a discovery that he fancied
ought to be utilized.</p>

<p>Either the night had grown lighter, as
though the moon might have arisen, and was
shining back of the heavy clouds, or else the
eyes of the boys, in growing accustomed to the
darkness, allowed them to see things better.</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed several trees of good size as we
came along, Roger,” he told his chum; “and if
only we can find one that is hollow, we need go
no further until morning.”</p>

<p>At that the other laughed as though pleased.</p>

<p>“If that’s all we need, Dick, how would this
one over here do for our purposes?” and,
speaking in this way, he directed the attention
of his chum to a tree not far away.</p>

<p>It was an unusually big tree, and both of them
could see, though a bit uncertainly, that it had
some sort of cavity at its base. A hasty examination
convinced them they had found just
what they were looking for.</p>

<p>“We can creep in through that hole easily
enough,” said Roger, “because it’s big enough
for a giant to pass through. I hope though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Dick, it doesn’t turn out to be the den of any
wild beast.”</p>

<p>“We can soon settle that!” declared Dick, as
he took up a long stick, over which he had just
tripped, and thrust it in through the opening.</p>

<p>As no sound of surly remonstrance followed
this action on his part, it became evident that
the hollow tree was not occupied by any animal.</p>

<p>“If it is a den there’s nobody at home right
now,” announced Roger; “so we can crawl
through the doorway and settle down.”</p>

<p>After his customary impetuous fashion he insisted
on being the one to lead the way, and
was quickly inside the hollow tree.</p>

<p>“How do you find it?” asked Dick, thrusting
his head through the opening.</p>

<p>“There seems to be plenty of room for two
in here,” was the quick reply; “and, although I
don’t just fancy the odor, still I think we could
do worse, especially if it comes on to rain hard.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing this Dick hastened to creep
through the hole, carrying his gun with him of
course. He had something on his mind, apparently,
for hardly had he reached the side of
the other boy than Dick thrust his gun into
Roger’s hands, remarking:</p>

<p>“I noticed an old stump just outside there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and I’d better go and roll it up, so as to cover
this opening, more or less.”</p>

<p>“Then you must be thinking that some animal
may come in here, and you mean to block the
passage so we will not be taken by surprise; is
that it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing less, Roger,” Dick replied, as he
started to crawl out again.</p>

<p>“If I can help you, let me know,” called out
Roger.</p>

<p>The stump did not prove to be very weighty,
and Dick rolled it deftly so that it covered all
but a small fraction of the opening. Then he
crept inside, and the two of them had little
trouble in closing most of the remainder of the
aperture.</p>

<p>“Well, to tell you the honest truth,” admitted
Roger, when this undertaking had been completed,
though plenty of air could still find ingress,
“I do feel a whole lot better, now that
we’ve shut the door. It can’t be very pleasant
to lie down to sleep in a hollow tree that may
be a panther’s lair, and to wake up to find the
savage beast coming in on you.”</p>

<p>Dick was as satisfied as his companion, even
if less vociferous about it.</p>

<p>“I guess that stump will make a good enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
door,” he went on to say, chuckling, “and if
we wake up to hear some one knocking, we can
ask who it is before we open up. Just as you
say, it makes us feel more secure.”</p>

<p>Satisfied with the way things were going
Roger soon settled down to make himself as
comfortable as the conditions allowed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps this isn’t as sweet and easy a bed
as my own at home,” he remarked, after yawning
several times; “but then, as my mother always
says, ‘beggars mustn’t be choosers.’ And
I can remember many a time when I’ve slept
in worse places than a hollow tree.”</p>

<p>“Remember before you go to sleep, Roger,
it’s understood that the one who happens to
hear anything suspicious is to wake the other
up. If you feel me touch you on the arm and
hear me whisper, keep as still as a church mouse.
It may mean that Indians are outside, and looking
for us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll recollect, Dick, you can depend on it;
and, if the tables should be turned, so that I am
the one to get wind of the danger first, I’ll do
the same to you. So now, let’s go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Roger found very little trouble in putting his
words into practice, and in a few minutes Dick
heard him breathing heavily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>As he felt very much inclined that way himself,
Dick made no effort to hold back sleep,
and in a short time both lads were fast locked
in slumber.</p>

<p>Some time passed, just how long neither of
them really knew, when Dick felt a violent tug
at his arm. He was wide-awake instantly, and
understood just where he was, as well as what
the jerk signified.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he whispered, as he felt for
his gun the first thing, as though its touch
would give him renewed confidence.</p>

<p>“Something or somebody is moving around
outside, Dick,” whispered Roger.</p>

<p>“Hist! listen!” remarked Dick, softly.</p>

<p>There was a slight scuffling sound, and the
stump at the opening moved violently. Then
came the loud sniffing of some animal that was
trying to thrust its nose through a very small
crevice and, apparently, could not understand
why the door was closed.</p>

<p>“It must be a bear,” said Dick, no longer
keeping his voice confined to a whisper, but
speaking aloud, “and this is his den. He wonders
what has happened, and it may be he scents
us, for he’s trying to push his way in!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE STORM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Roger</span> was considerably relieved when he
heard his chum say this with so much confidence.
A bear might be troublesome, but it was
not to be compared with an Indian, for the latter
was likely to have allies close at hand who
could be summoned by a signal whoop.</p>

<p>“Do you think the beast can move the
stump?” he asked Dick, at the same time feeling
for his knife, which the other had turned
over to Roger on discovering that it was really
his property.</p>

<p>“He is trying hard to do so,” replied Dick.</p>

<p>“Just listen how he keeps on sniffing at that
crack,” continued the other boy. “He knows
that somebody has taken to his hollow tree, and
he doesn’t seem to like it at all. How about
giving him a shot, Dick? At such close range
you could easily knock him over.”</p>

<p>Dick, however, had his own ideas about that.
At least, he did not make any preparations for
the shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, Roger,” he finally explained,
“I’d rather not waste my powder and
ball on the old fellow. He’d be too tough for
us to use as food, and besides, the sound of the
report might bring some of the Indians down
on us.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are right, Dick,” commented
Roger; “but it looks as if we might have to do
something to frighten the bear away. There
he starts again, trying to thrust the stump aside,
and as sure as anything, Dick, the breach is getting
a little wider every time he works at it.”</p>

<p>“It seems so,” agreed Dick, “and, as you say,
we ought to do something to put a stop to his
scratching and dragging. Wait a minute, I’ve
an idea I can fix it!”</p>

<p>With these words he put his long rifle behind
him so that it was safe in Roger’s hands. In
case of actual necessity the latter would know
what to do with the fire-arm; but just then he
was very curious to learn what Dick had arranged.</p>

<p>He could hear him moving, and he seemed to
lean forward until his hands were perilously
near the small opening at which the nose of the
bear was working just as the snout of a hog
might be used to move an obstacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The champing of teeth, along with the loud
sniffing, continued.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Dick?” asked Roger,
finally, unable to stand the suspense any longer.</p>

<p>“Oh!” came the cheery reply, “I have wasted
a charge or two of powder, placing it as near
the opening as I can, and running a thread this
way. Now I have my flint and steel ready, and,
as soon as he starts to poking his nose in at the
hole again, I’ll strike fire, and explode the powder
in his face!”</p>

<p>Roger saw the object of this, and was considerably
interested in the outcome.</p>

<p>“I hope he gets the full benefit of the flash,”
he observed.</p>

<p>Dick saw his chance just then, and he could
be heard striking the flint and steel rapidly together
after the manner of one whom long experience
in this line had made almost perfect.</p>

<p>There came a little shower of descending
sparks, and then a sudden brilliant flash that
lit up the interior of the hollow tree as though
the sun had found a means of ingress.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Roger, clapping his hands
in glee, “that was the time you gave old Eph
the scare of his life! Hear him plunging off,
will you, Dick? It seems as if he’d lost all desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to make the acquaintance of his new lodgers.
And I don’t think we’ll be bothered any more
by Mr. Bear, do you?”</p>

<p>Dick also laughed softly as he replied:</p>

<p>“He must have had his nose singed that time,
and got a bad fright in the bargain, so I reckon
we’ll not be annoyed again.”</p>

<p>“This powder smoke is choking me, Dick.”</p>

<p>“But it’s slowly rising in the tree, and things
are getting better right along,” Roger was told.
“We’ll wait awhile until the air is purer, and
after that we’ll drag the old stump back to
where it was before the bear moved it.”</p>

<p>“And then?” queried Roger.</p>

<p>“Go to sleep again, if you feel like it, because
we have some hours of the night still ahead of
us,” Dick calmly told him.</p>

<p>Before they could settle down they noticed
that the wind was soughing through the trees
with a louder note than before.</p>

<p>“That storm is coming closer all the while,”
remarked Dick, “and we needn’t be surprised to
hear thunder at any time now.”</p>

<p>“If it does come,” added Roger, sleepily,
“we’ll be glad to have such a fine shelter in the
rain. But it may fool us after all, and for one
I don’t mean to lie awake waiting for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick, too, managed to get to sleep before a
great while. Both of them were presently
aroused by a loud crash of thunder.</p>

<p>“Why, it did get here after all, Dick!” exclaimed
Roger, the first thing.</p>

<p>“Listen and you can hear the rain further
along beating down on the forest trees. One
good thing about it is that the storm will probably
not be a long one.”</p>

<p>Dick’s words were immediately followed by a
vivid flash of lightning, and then came another
loud detonation that seemed to shake the earth.</p>

<p>In these present days two wide-awake boys
who had picked up some knowledge of woodcraft
would be very much alarmed to find themselves
in a hollow tree during an electrical
storm, knowing that there was always a chance
of the lightning’s striking such an object and
bringing about their destruction.</p>

<p>Dick and Roger were not worried on that
point. Perhaps it was because they were accustomed
to taking hazards; or it may have sprung
from ignorance of the danger.</p>

<p>However, the hollow tree had lost its top
long years ago, and was surrounded by loftier
trees so the chances of its being struck were not
serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the rain came, and, from the sounds that
reached their ears, the boys decided that it was
almost a tropical downpour. Roger was on the
alert to discover whether their shelter was going
to prove its worth, or begin to leak. After
some time had passed he voiced his conviction
in his usual fashion.</p>

<p>“Not a drop so far, Dick, and I believe we’re
going to keep dry jackets through the whole
downpour. Why, this is better than being in
one of the tents, for they nearly always let a
stream of water trickle down your neck when
you’re not expecting it. I think we’re mighty
lucky to have such good shelter.”</p>

<p>“And I agree with every word you say,
Roger,” his companion added.</p>

<p>“How is the night going, do you know?” continued
the other.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I can hardly say, Roger. At a
guess I might venture to say that we may
have something like two hours more of darkness.”</p>

<p>“Then all I hope is the storm will peter out
before dawn, so we can start for the river right
away. We ought to come upon the expedition
by evening, unless we get lost, and that is something
not likely to happen to boys like us, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
have lived in the woods since they were knee-high
to grasshoppers.”</p>

<p>“One thing sure, we have had all the sleep
we’re going to get to-night,” Dick remarked.</p>

<p>“It seems to me the rain has slackened some.
At least, it doesn’t make such a terrible noise
when it strikes the trees. But there was a
pretty lively wind blowing, Dick, and I think I
heard more than one tree crash down before the
gale.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added the other. “And this old
wreck did some groaning, too. Once I was in
a sweat thinking it might go toppling over; but
the other trees must have protected it some, for
it stood through the wild storm.”</p>

<p>When Roger hazarded the opinion that the
gale was abating he spoke the truth, for in a
short time it became manifest that the thunder
came from a more distant point, the lightning
was not so brilliant, and the rain itself began to
fall more lightly.</p>

<p>In fact, things took on such a different tone
that Roger actually settled himself down to try
for a little more sleep.</p>

<p>Dick had been too thoroughly aroused to think
of doing this. He continued to sit there, keeping
a vigil on the crack, through which he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
he would catch the first glimpse of breaking day.
He amused himself while sitting thus by letting
his thought go back to the happy home far down
the “Big Muddy,” where his father and his
mother, his little brother Sam, and his grandparents
besides, occupied the big cabin in the
clearing, close to the one where Roger’s parents
lived.</p>

<p>Finally, Dick discovered that it was no longer
pitch dark outside. The moon had broken out
from the scattering storm clouds, and was giving
a fair amount of light.</p>

<p>Dick, always in touch with the positions of the
heavenly bodies, knew, after he had located the
fragment of a moon, that morning was indeed
close at hand. Indeed, he believed that in less
than half an hour the dawn would break.</p>

<p>He allowed Roger to sleep until it was broad
daylight, and then, acting under the belief that
they had better be on their way, he laid a hand
on the other’s arm.</p>

<p>“Morning has come, and we ought to be getting
out of here,” Dick told his comrade, as he
felt the other move under his touch.</p>

<p>“Why, I did go to sleep after all, it seems,”
muttered Roger, as though he considered this
the queerest thing of all; but Dick only smiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
for he knew of old some of the little weaknesses
of his chum.</p>

<p>They succeeded in pushing the old stump
away from the opening, leaving a gap big enough
for them to crawl through.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Bear ever takes the trouble to come
back to his den,” remarked Roger, as he surveyed
the big tree with its hollow butt, “he’s
welcome to his old quarters. I’d like to tell him
that his hole is all right, too, when a fellow is
caught in a storm; but we have other fish to fry
just now.”</p>

<p>His words reminded him of the fine mess of
trout they had caught on the preceding day,
just before the trap set by the cunning Indians
had been sprung, and shortly afterwards he remarked:</p>

<p>“I do hope our friends found all the strings
of trout we left along the bank of that stream;
and that there were more than they could use
at one time. It would be fine if we got a taste
of the same, Dick, after all this fuss.”</p>

<p>“I was just thinking,” remarked practical
Dick, who certainly was not bothering his head
about trout, or any other kind of food, “that,
after all, that storm may have done us one kindness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me how, then?” demanded Roger, who
failed to agree with him until he could be shown
the facts.</p>

<p>“The rain must have washed all our tracks
out, so not even the sharpest-eyed Indian brave
could follow our trail,” explained the other, and
of course Roger found himself in full accord
with the theory advanced, for, like the story of
Columbus and the envious Spanish courtiers,
things looked very different after the explanation.</p>

<p>With a last backward look toward the friendly
old tree that had afforded them shelter in the
storm, the two lads tightened their belts and
set off on their long tramp, expecting to strike
the bank of the Missouri by the time the sun was
ready to set.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>UNDER THE FALLEN FOREST MONARCH</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">There!</span> that makes the fourth tree I’ve seen
blown down in the storm,” remarked Roger,
after they had been walking through the forest
for some time.</p>

<p>“Yes, and in every case if you went to the
trouble to examine those trees,” he was told by
Dick, “you would find that they were rotten at
the heart. They may keep on standing up with
the rest, and seem to be perfect, but when the
wind sweeps through the forest it searches out
the weak and imperfect trees, and topples them
over.”</p>

<p>“That must be what grandfather means when
he talks about the ‘survival of the fittest,’”
Roger mused. “He says that Nature knows
what is best for everything, and keeps thinning
out the weak ones along every line.”</p>

<p>“Then there must have been a lot of poor
trash over yonder,” chuckled Dick, “for I can
see a number of trees down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! what was that!” suddenly asked Roger.</p>

<p>“It sounded to me like a groan,” his companion
admitted, as both of them stood still in order
to listen.</p>

<p>“There it comes again, Dick, and, just as you
said, it must be a groan. I wonder if any one
could have been caught under a tree when it
fell?”</p>

<p>“We must be cautious how we move forward,”
as Dick’s advice, “because we know
the treacherous nature of these Indians.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it might turn out to be a
trap?” demanded Roger.</p>

<p>“There is always a chance of that, so, while
we make our way in that direction, we must be
ready to run if we discover any lurking reds
about.”</p>

<p>Dick also kept his rifle in readiness in case of
a sudden emergency. It might be a shot would
check a rush on the part of their enemies, and
thus enable the boys to get a fair start.</p>

<p>Guided by the groans, which now came louder
and more frequently, they were not long in making
a discovery.</p>

<p>“Dick, I see him!” exclaimed Roger, in fresh
excitement; “and, sure enough, he is caught in
the branches of that big tree over there. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
isn’t a trap after all, but some one in trouble.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 316px;">

<div class="caption">“THEY PUSHED FORWARD, AND WERE SOON AT THE FALLEN TREE”</div>
</div>

<p>“And an Indian at that, Roger,” added the
other, as he, too, managed to catch a glimpse of
the unfortunate one.</p>

<p>“Will that make any difference; or do you
think he may be just shamming?” asked Roger,
hesitating.</p>

<p>“There is no mistake about his being in a bad
fix,” ventured Dick. “He may not be terribly
hurt, but the tree has pinned him down, you can
see; and if we left the poor fellow there he would
either starve to death or else be devoured by
the wild beasts.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we never could have the heart to do
that,” asserted Roger, who possessed a generous
nature, like all his headstrong class.</p>

<p>They pushed forward, and were soon at the
fallen tree. The Indian must have discovered
their presence, for he had ceased groaning, as
though too proud to show any sign of cowardice.
A brave would sooner have his hand cut off than
be reckoned timid or weak.</p>

<p>“How are we going to get him out of that
trap?” Roger remarked, after they had looked
the situation over. “We have no hatchet for
cutting the limb, and my knife would never do
the job in a day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s held down as if in a vise,” Dick observed
thoughtfully, “and I can see only one
way of getting him loose. Let me have your
knife and I’ll hack my way in close to him.
There seems to be just one avenue open for
that.”</p>

<p>Roger, filled with curiosity, watched his cousin
set to work. He could readily understand how
the other intended to reach the side of the imprisoned
brave, but just what means he expected
to use in order to free the warrior Roger was
unable to guess.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards Dick had gained the
side of the brave, to whom he spoke a few words;
and, doubtful whether he was understood, these
were supplemented by various reassuring gestures.</p>

<p>Then, to the astonishment of Roger, Dick
started to dig furiously in the ground. At first
his intentions were a mystery to Roger, who
wrinkled his brow as he looked on. All at once,
however, he grasped the idea.</p>

<p>“Now I can see what you’re up to, Dick,”
he called out; “and I must say it looks like a
winning scheme. All you have to do is to dig
under the brave, and let him sink down a little.
Then, when the pressure of those limbs grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
less, he can either squirm out himself, or be
dragged forth.”</p>

<p>That, in fact, was the idea Dick had conceived
in his fertile brain. He continued to delve
away with a steady purpose in view, and presently
it could be seen that he was making an impression
on the earth. The trapped Indian
brave began to sink downward by slow degrees
until finally the pressure had relaxed to such
an extent that by making a great effort, and assisted
by Dick, he managed to wriggle out from
under the limbs of the fallen tree.</p>

<p>He had been hurt in various places, though
Dick did not believe any of his wounds were
really serious. Accustomed, as they were, to
treating injuries, it was only natural for the
boys to make up their minds that they would do
something for the poor fellow.</p>

<p>When Dick made motions to this effect, the
Indian allowed them to do what they willed, although
he watched every movement with eyes
that were filled with curiosity.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether he’s more surprised at
seeing us have this soothing ointment mother
made along with us, or that ‘palefaces’ should
go to such trouble just for an Indian?” Roger
remarked, as he assisted in the work. (<a id="Note_6r"></a><a href="#Note_6">Note 6</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter much which affects him
most,” said Dick, calmly, “we are doing just
what our parents have taught us to do. Besides,
how can we tell whether this brave is an
enemy or a friend?”</p>

<p>“They say an Indian never forgets an injury,
or an act of kindness,” ventured Roger; “and,
if that is true, we can count on one friend among
the Dacotahs, for I’m sure he belongs to that
tribe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is a Dacotah, but they all look alike
to me, so I couldn’t say whether he was among
those who captured us or not. He seems to be
listening to what we are saying, and I really believe
he half understands our talk. Perhaps
he knows a little English, for there have
been white trappers who have penetrated this
far.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you try him, and see if he can understand,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“I mean to do that,” was the reply, “because
I’d like to put a spoke in the wheel of that revengeful
Andrew Waller. He has told these
foolish Indians we are the sons of the Great
White Father at Washington, and that if we
were held as prisoners a mighty ransom would
be paid for our release. We must convince the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
reds that it is false, and that we are only ordinary
white boys.”</p>

<p>This idea held some weight with Dick, and
after completing his work in connection with the
brave’s wounds he commenced the attempt to
talk with him.</p>

<p>At first it looked as though there would be little
chance of success; but after a little he succeeded
in getting the painted brave to understand
what he was trying to explain. This was
done by means of single words, accompanied by
much gesturing and pointing.</p>

<p>If the Indian had not already known about
the boys, and what was said about their being
the sons of the White Father he could never
have understood matters at all. Gradually
Dick began to believe he was hammering the
facts into the head of the other. He saw a light
as of comprehension dawning on his painted
face.</p>

<p>“I do believe you’ve managed to pound it into
his brain, Dick,” said Roger, who had been an
earnest witness of all this. “He looks as if he
knew what you wanted him to do. See, he even
nods his head when you speak.”</p>

<p>Dick felt that he had reason to be proud of
what he had done. To get an Indian, who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
not talk English, beyond a few words, to understand
that they were only ordinary, every-day
boys instead of the important personages Andrew
Waller had pictured, was a triumph indeed.</p>

<p>“I am asking him to pass the news along, and
spread it far and wide,” explained Dick, as he
continued his gestures and forceful words; “and
I think he knows. Here, let me do a little picture
writing for him; perhaps that may help.”</p>

<p>He picked up a piece of smooth bark, and, using
the point of Roger’s hunting knife, managed
to scratch several crude designs upon it. Two
of these represented the rising and the setting
sun. Then a figure with a Dacotah head-dress
stood half way between with arms outstretched.</p>

<p>Showing this to the brave, Dick once more began
to speak and make gestures. While he
could not of course be certain, still he had every
reason to believe that the other understood what
he was driving at, for he nodded, touched each
of the boys on the chest, then shook his head
in the negative, and said something in the Dacotah
tongue which Dick fancied meant White
Father.</p>

<p>“That’s the best I can do with him, Roger;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and now we must be on our way again. Whether
it works or not, at least we can feel that we have
done the right thing.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE RETURN FROM CAPTIVITY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">They</span> parted from the Dacotah brave with
what was doubtless intended to be grateful gestures
on his part.</p>

<p>“He seems to understand that we have played
the part of friends,” said Roger, “and I think
if the chance ever comes up he will stand by us.”</p>

<p>“I am of the same opinion,” declared Dick,
“though for that matter I hope we may never
need his help. After all, we did not lose much
time, and it was worth while to save a life.”</p>

<p>They pushed on diligently for a long time.
Dick was not in doubt as to his course, for he
had taken particular pains to notice as they
came along on the preceding day, in the company
of the Indians.</p>

<p>When Roger happened to ask once if he were
quite sure the river lay directly ahead of them,
Dick answered confidently.</p>

<p>“Unless it makes a great sweep to the north
somewhere above us we will run upon the river
by nightfall, take my word for it;” and Roger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
accustomed to depending fully on his comrade,
never doubted after that moment.</p>

<p>Something else was soon upon his mind, however,
and he voiced his thoughts by appealing to
Dick.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be dangerous if you
shot your gun off just once, in case we sighted
some game? I feel very hungry, for that supper
the Indians gave us didn’t seem to do me
much good. And breakfast is one of my best
meals, you know.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed at seeing the appealing look on
his chum’s face.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the danger of the shot’s being
heard is one-half as great as you think you are
of starving to death,” he told Roger.</p>

<p>“Then you agree, do you?” demanded the
other, eagerly. “I’ll keep my eyes peeled for
sight of a deer, and I do hope it isn’t going to
be long before we get a chance at one.”</p>

<p>As luck would have it, before another ten minutes
had passed the opportunity he was hoping
for came their way. Dick was ready, and with
the report of his gun a yearling doe fell in a
heap, just when in the act of plunging into the
dense thicket.</p>

<p>Of course Roger would not think of any delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in getting a fire going and some of the tender
meat broiling before the flames. While he
looked after the fire Dick cut up the game, and
it was not long before an appetizing odor began
to make both boys wishful for the feast to begin.</p>

<p>“We can make up for this stop,” said Roger
as he sat there devouring piece after piece of the
half-cooked venison, “by not halting at noon
for a rest. Then again, we can hurry our steps
at times and so get along faster.”</p>

<p>“No trouble about that,” Dick assured him,
“for I figure that we have plenty of time to get
there by dark. You remember that we were
only on the move some six hours yesterday, and
we have the whole of to-day for tramping.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, Dick, this reminds me of how
we chased after the expedition for weeks and
weeks when determined to find Jasper Williams,
and get that paper signed for our parents.
Hundreds of miles we followed the trail as it
ascended the Missouri River, until at last we
overtook them.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“What we did once we can do again, this time
on a small scale,” Dick assured him. “I was
just watching those crows over there in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
tree-top. They seem to be holding a regular
caucus, and keep on scolding like everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added the other boy, “and sometimes
crows turn out to be a pest in lots of ways besides
eating the settler’s corn. Old hunters
have told me they hide from crows whenever
they find themselves in hostile territory, because
through their cawing the birds tell the Indians
strangers are in the woods.”</p>

<p>“There, the whole lot has flown away, and
making all sorts of noises in the bargain,” Dick
went on to say. “I don’t like crows myself any
too much. They are too noisy, and seem to
think every one is trying to creep up on them
for a shot.”</p>

<p>“When we do strike the river, Dick, can we
easily tell whether the expedition has passed or
not?”</p>

<p>“All we have to do is to examine the ground,
for their horses would leave a plain trail, you
know, Roger.”</p>

<p>“And if, after searching, we do not find any
sign, we will know they haven’t come along yet.
In that case all we have to do will be to sit down,
and take things easy until they show up.”</p>

<p>Roger seemed to have left most of his troubles
behind, after making a good breakfast on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
deer meat. With the intention of chiding him
for displaying any eagerness for food when
there was none to be had, Dick took up the subject
again as they trudged manfully onward.</p>

<p>“It’s very plain to be seen that you’d never
make a good Indian brave, Roger,” was what
he told the other, and this excited the boy’s curiosity
just as Dick knew would be the case.</p>

<p>“Tell me why,” he demanded. “I always
thought I could stand pain without flinching as
well as any Indian boy; and I’ve learned a lot
about wild life in the bargain. Where do I fall
short, Dick?”</p>

<p>“It’s just this way,” his cousin told him.
“An Indian boy is taught never to display his
feelings, no matter what he suffers inwardly. If
he were struck by a poisonous rattlesnake, and
could feel his body swelling, not a whimper
would come from his lips.”</p>

<p>“Well, what has that to do with me, Dick?
So far I have never been attacked by a rattlesnake,
though I’ve killed plenty of the ugly varmints,
I wager.”</p>

<p>“But you did put on a long face, and you complained
because for once you missed your breakfast.
Now, an Indian boy would never have
said a word, but held in grimly to the end. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
that I blame you, remember, for I was hungry
myself, and ready to use my gun, even before
you mentioned it.”</p>

<p>They both laughed at that.</p>

<p>“We were born ‘paleface’ boys,” said Roger,
“and it’s hard for the leopard to change its
spots, they say. When we’re hungry we know
it, yes, and we don’t mind letting other people
know it, too, if that will help things along.”</p>

<p>Noon came and went.</p>

<p>They kept persistently moving forward. Occasionally
they came to open places in the forest
where the grass grew green, and often did
they glimpse deer feeding in these glades. Once
they even saw a small herd of buffaloes trooping
off, having apparently winded the boys.</p>

<p>But Dick made no motion to use his gun again.
They had all the fresh meat they required, and
powder and balls were too precious to be needlessly
wasted. So the afternoon came and
found them keeping up that determined pace.
If either of them felt tired they failed to mention
the fact, which in itself was pretty positive
evidence that they possessed many of the best
traits of the Indian character, after all.</p>

<p>From long habit they were accustomed to such
exercise as this, and would not have complained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had the tramp kept up far into the coming night.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon when
Roger gave a low exclamation of delight.</p>

<p>“I can see the river ahead of us, Dick!” he
cried, with a vein of deep satisfaction in his
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been waiting to hear you say
that, Roger, for I glimpsed it five minutes back.
So you see after all we have made good time.
We shall be there long before sunset.”</p>

<p>“I must say I am glad to know it,” Roger
admitted; and then hastily added: “Not that
I doubted your word a bit, but then, ‘seeing is
believing,’ you know, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and, confident as I was myself, I am
relieved to see the river glimmering in the sunlight
before us,” Dick frankly admitted.</p>

<p>“It can hardly be more than two miles or so
away from here, wouldn’t you say?” questioned
Roger, always ready to have any assertion he
might make backed up by the word of his chum,
in whom he had such positive faith.</p>

<p>“About that,” the other told him, as they once
more started ahead.</p>

<p>When finally they stood on the high bank of
the river, no longer the mighty stream they
knew it down near their home, and looked at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
opposite shore, the sun was still more than an
hour high.</p>

<p>“Now to find out if they have passed by, and
whether we will have to keep on up the river,”
said Dick, as he began to look about him.</p>

<p>A brief search convinced them that no horses
had passed that point. They saw the marks of
deer, and buffaloes, as well as some very large
imprints made by cloven hoofs, that startled
the boys, for they did not know what sort of
strange animal had made them; but it was sure
that horses had not been present.</p>

<p>“That settles it then,” said Roger, with a sigh
of relief, for he would much rather just sit there
and wait for the expedition to come along, than
be compelled to follow for miles after it.</p>

<p>“We will make camp here to-night if they fail
to show up,” asserted Dick, which piece of information
pleased Roger, his pleasure showing
in the broad smile of contentment that broke
over his face.</p>

<p>With plenty of good venison to last them
through many days, what need had they to
worry? They knew the exploring party bound
for the other side of the mountains was sure to
come along, sooner or later; when they could
once more join their good friends, and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
their accustomed places as though nothing unusual
had happened.</p>

<p>Dick selected a certain spot on which to settle
and wait for the exploring party. In doing
this he had in mind the fact that it afforded
them a clear view down the river. A bend lay
just a quarter of a mile below their position,
around which they could expect the boats to appear,
sooner or later.</p>

<p>Lying at their ease the boys talked of many
things as they awaited the coming of the expedition.
Their recent experience of course came in
for a good share of attention, for it still thrilled
them to compare notes of the night attack, when
those hideous whoops were ringing in their ears,
together with the heavy percussion of blows as
the fierce Shoshones invaded the camp of the
Dacotahs and struggled hand-to-hand for the
supremacy.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking lower and lower, so that
it really began to look as though, after all, the
boys would have to make camp where they were.
Apparently the expedition had spent some little
time looking for the lost ones, and Dick had
struck the river further up than they had as yet
penetrated.</p>

<p>Suddenly Roger discovered a moving object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
down the river. Then, around the bend, a boat
came in sight, in which they could see white
men, some of them soldiers.</p>

<p>At the same time voices from the shore
reached their ears, and they caught fugitive
glimpses of moving figures advancing along a
buffalo trail close to the edge of the bank. These
latter they realized must be the party mounted
on the horses, and who always kept near the
boats for mutual protection and company.</p>

<p>“That settles it then, Dick. We will not have
to camp by ourselves to-night; and, after all,
I’m glad of it. Not that I don’t enjoy being off
with you alone, but up here, so far away from
the settlements, it makes me feel better to know
I am in company with some dozens of other
whites.”</p>

<p>“I think there’s still another reason why you
are glad they are coming,” ventured Dick,
shrewdly; “you keep on hoping they may not
have devoured all of those fine trout we caught
yesterday, and that you can still have a chance
to taste some of them.”</p>

<p>Roger would neither admit nor deny the accusation,
but only laughed and prepared to wave
his cap toward the men in the leading boat a
minute later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>It could be seen that quite some excitement
followed the discovery that the two missing boys
were above, waiting for the boats to arrive.
Voices were heard conveying the intelligence to
the other boats, and loud shouts attested to the
fact that the men rejoiced over the safe return
of the lost ones.</p>

<p>The spot offered very good accommodations
for stopping over night, and so, upon arriving
opposite the lads, the boats made for the shore.
Dick and Roger soon found themselves being
heartily greeted by all their good friends. Most
of the men had really given them up for lost
when they learned the fact that they had been
carried off by the Dacotahs, after being so
treacherously led into a trap by the seemingly
friendly brave who had loitered so long about
the camp.</p>

<p>The two captains were among the first to
shake the hands of the pioneer boys, and assure
them of their deep satisfaction at seeing them
again. Of course every one was anxious to
know what had happened to them, and the boys
were compelled to tell their story again and
again as the tents were being pitched and preparations
made for the night camp.</p>

<p>It was admitted by all that they had been exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
lucky. At the same time, every one
knew that the boys deserved great credit for
their clever escape from the hands of the Dacotahs.
Dick had planned it all very cleverly
so as to make their escape possible even though
there had been no midnight attack on the part
of the Shoshones, though, of course, they might
have been followed and had further trouble.</p>

<p>As darkness set in, the bustling scene gave the
two lads much pleasure and contentment. They
could not but compare this night with the one
that had gone just before, when they had sat in
the midst of their dusky captors, not knowing
what lay in store for them in the near future.</p>

<p>No sooner was supper set before them than
Roger turned a beaming face toward Dick, as
he voiced his feelings of delight.</p>

<p>“You see, they didn’t make way with those
fish after all, Dick, because they were not found
until late in the evening. So they just cleaned
and salted them down, and we’re to have the
greatest treat you ever tasted to-night. It
sometimes pays to wait patiently for things to
come along,” and, seeing Dick smiling, he
winked knowingly, after which he bustled off to
watch the process by means of which the fish
were to be prepared for the coming meal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>AT THE FOOT OF THE ROCKIES</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> time is coming, and very soon at that,
I guess, Dick, when we must expect a great
change in our going.”</p>

<p>Roger made this remark some two weeks after
their adventure with the rascally Dacotahs, who
had been misled by the false words of Andrew
Waller. All this while the whites had been
steadfastly pushing farther and farther up the
narrowing Missouri, until navigation had become
very difficult.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know what you mean by that,” remarked
Dick. “Every day now we are having
more and more trouble with the batteaux. They
get aground so often that much valuable time is
wasted in freeing them.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if we might be nearly at the headwaters
of the Missouri, the river is getting so
shallow,” Roger observed.</p>

<p>“That is probably partly due to the time of
year,” explained Dick. “We are well along in
August, you must remember, and the snow
doesn’t melt as easily up in the mountain canyons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
now as it did earlier in the season. Besides,
we have had little heavy rain, if you stop
to think.”</p>

<p>“What do you expect Captain Lewis will do,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“I heard him saying only to-day, when they
were working at the boat which stuck on the
shoal, that it looked as though the limit had been
reached. You understand what that means, of
course, Roger?”</p>

<p>“I believe I do,” was the reply. “From what
I’ve picked up here and there it appears to be
the plan to leave part of the expedition in camp
somewhere along the upper reaches of the Missouri
until next year, while the rest make a dash
for the Coast on the horses.”</p>

<p>“It was fixed,” continued Dick, “that Captain
Clark should lead the party headed for the
sea; but I have heard since that Captain Lewis
has changed his mind. He doesn’t feel like being
cheated out of that glorious sight after all
he has passed through.”</p>

<p>“And who can blame him?” burst out the impetuous
Roger. “I only hope they let us keep
along with them. We have a horse apiece, you
know, and could easily hold our own when it
came to hunting for game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Captain Lewis promised that we should set
eyes on the sea if any one in the party did, and
he is a man of his word, you know.”</p>

<p>“I should never get over the disappointment,”
declared Roger, “if anything prevented
us from keeping on to the end. We have made
great sacrifices in order to be in the company.
Besides, I am fairly burning to set eyes on some
of the many wonders we expect to meet with in
crossing the big mountains of rock. The Indians
have kept telling us about strange animals
to be encountered there.”</p>

<p>“Those mountains,” Dick went on to say,
“are the home of the terrible brown bear which
Captain Lewis has called the grizzly. We know
how they can fight, because we had an experience
in a cave with one that we’re not likely ever
to forget.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, “and according to the
Indians’ way of doing, we’re entitled to wear
those dreadful claws around our necks, after
slaying the monster at close quarters. Whenever
you run across an Indian with the claws of
a grizzly bear worn as a necklace you can count
on it that he’s proved his right to the name of
warrior.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>“Then we’ve also heard of a beast living
among the crags of these mountains that has immense
curved horns, upon which he alights after
throwing himself from some lofty height. That
may be only a fairy story, but I’d like to see for
myself if there’s any truth in it.</p>

<p>“As for me, Dick, I’ve already made up my
mind that I’ll shoot one of those queer beasts,
and get a sample of the curved horns, if ever
the chance comes my way. Just yesterday I
was thinking of the wonderful tracks we saw
when we were having that adventure with the
Dacotahs, and hoping that some of these fine
days we might come upon the animal that made
them.”</p>

<p>“I have tried my best, Roger, to learn what
the beast looks like, and the nearest any Indian
has been able to tell is that once in a while a
monster of the deer tribe is seen in these regions.
None of the trappers in our party have
an idea what it can be, save Batiste, who declares
he has shot just such a great beast up in
Canada.”</p>

<p>“Then he must mean a moose!” exclaimed
Roger, looking intensely interested. “Come to
think of it now, I don’t see why a moose might
not wander over here. They live only in cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
countries, I am told, but in the winter it must
be bitter enough up here to please any one.”</p>

<p>Just as the boys had said, when talking matters
over between themselves, the river had become
so shallow that it was folly to try to push
the heavy batteaux any further up the current.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a permanent camp was to be established
on the river bank, where a part of the
men would be left in as comfortable circumstances
as the conditions permitted. Here they
were to stay until they were rejoined the following
summer by the returning explorers, after
they had been to the Coast.</p>

<p>Those who were to be left behind were to establish
relations and make friends with the
neighboring Indian tribes, serve them as physicians,
and do what hunting was necessary.</p>

<p>Of course the scene in the camp that night was
an unusual one. The men who were to accompany
the two captains had been advised of their
good fortune, and, while they showed signs of
pleasure, at the same time they knew that the
final stages of the big journey would be filled
with peril, so, in one way, they really envied
those who could stay behind in comfort and
peace.</p>

<p>There was an air of half-suppressed excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
throughout the camp as the men conferred
together, exchanged some of their possessions,
and in numerous ways made ready for the parting
that was coming so soon.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis did not have many preparations
to make, for all along he and his able ally
had seen that everything was kept at the highest
notch of efficiency.</p>

<p>“I really do believe,” said Roger, as he and
his chum sat watching the many sights of the
camp that evening, “that Captain Lewis has
planned for every little thing that could happen;
and whoever is left in charge here will
know what he is to do from day to day, just as
if he got his orders fresh from headquarters.”</p>

<p>“That is partly the result of having a man
like Captain Clark along,” explained Dick.
“He believes in method, and carries his ideas
out as a military man should. Captain Lewis
could not have found a better companion for
his venture than he did.”</p>

<p>“It is settled that we are to go along with
them, of course?” fretted Roger, who knew perfectly
well that this matter had been arranged,
but wanted to hear his comrade say so.</p>

<p>“We have the word of the commander for it,
and that ought to be enough, Roger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>One whole day they spent in the camp by the
river so that nothing should be neglected. Then,
on the following morning, bright and early the
good-bys were said, and the little party,
mounted on the horses, set out to plunge still
deeper into the unknown wilderness toward the
glittering prize that tempted them—the sun-kissed
sea that lay far away over mountains and
across burning deserts.</p>

<p>It was only natural that every one should be
more or less affected over the parting. None
of them could tell what the future held. Surrounded
by a trackless wilderness, many hundreds
of miles from a single white man’s village,
and with treacherous savages to deal with,
the chances of their ever coming together again
seemed very remote.</p>

<p>During that day both the boys were inclined
to be unusually quiet and thoughtful. Indeed,
for that matter, every one of the riders seemed
to have lost his ordinary spirits, although, of
course, this feeling of depression would soon
wear away, and by degrees the men would learn
to face the situation bravely.</p>

<p>It was evident to every one that the party was
now approaching the foothills of those great
mountains of which so much had been heard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Captain Lewis knew that, in order to cross them
with as little hard work as possible, they must
head for a pass of which they had been told by
some of the Indians. Unless they could find
this, their efforts would be in vain, and they
must turn back, defeated in their daring plans.</p>

<p>Three days after leaving their comrades the
advancing party came to a good camping ground
early in the afternoon, and, as the horses were
really in need of a rest, it was concluded to stop
here for the night.</p>

<p>This was an opportunity the two boys had
been waiting for, and they had little difficulty in
getting permission from the commander to indulge
themselves in a short hunt.</p>

<p>The camp was in need of fresh meat, though
not desperately so; and if only a deer could be
taken it would afford them a few good meals.
Captain Lewis, knowing Roger’s headstrong
ways, took particular pains to caution them before
they set out.</p>

<p>“See that you take no unnecessary chances,
my boys,” was what he had said. “We would
be very sorry, indeed, to have to bear your parents
bad news when next we see St. Louis. But
I feel that, so long as Dick is along, you will be
careful. And, if you can bring the carcass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
a young deer back with you, so much the better.”</p>

<p>It was a fine afternoon in late summer. There
did not seem to be any sign of stormy weather
in prospect, from which fact the boys felt sure
they would not be compelled to look for a hollow
tree as before.</p>

<p>First of all they were wise enough to take
their bearings, for they certainly did not want
to lose themselves in the vast wilderness, since
they could no longer depend on finding their
friends by simply hunting for the river.</p>

<p>Then the next thing was to hunt up into the
wind. This was, of course, done so that if they
were approaching some keen-nosed game the
animal might not scent their presence, and depart
before they could get a chance to fire a single
shot.</p>

<p>It was a wild section of country. They could
see, beyond, the mighty barrier of mountains
that stood between them and their goal. The
woods were composed of scrub trees, with openings
here and there; though in most sections,
east of the chain of mountains, prairie land existed.</p>

<p>From where they looked up to the dizzy
heights, the sides of the mountains seemed bleak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and rocky. They had been told, however, that
on the western slope vegetation grew plentifully,
as the winds from the ocean brought much
rain, though little of this crossed the divide.</p>

<p>The boys pursued their hunt for nearly an
hour without coming upon any game, although
they saw plenty of signs of it, and were always
counting on making a discovery. Versed in forest
lore, they knew how to creep along without
making any sound likely to give warning of their
approach.</p>

<p>All conversation had been tabooed long since,
for even Roger knew that an incautious word
might spoil their plans, and give the unseen
deer notice of their presence in the vicinity.</p>

<p>It was while they were thus moving along that
Dick suddenly thrust out a hand and drew his
companion to a standstill. Roger turned his
head quickly, as though he did not comprehend
what this meant, only to see Dick’s finger
pressed on his lips to indicate silence.</p>

<p>At the same moment Roger himself caught
the low thud of hoofs. Some animal was certainly
approaching them, and the singular
“clicking” that accompanied each thud told
them the beast must have cloven hoofs like those
of a deer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>A few seconds passed during which the
strange sounds grew louder, and then, as the
bushes parted, the two boys gazed upon a sight
such as had never before greeted their astonished
eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE DEATH OF THE BULL MOOSE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Seen</span> for the first time in all their experience
as hunters of big game, the animal that stood
there facing the two boys was remarkable
enough to arouse their interest to fever pitch.</p>

<p>Tawny of hue, and possessing an enormous
muzzle, together with towering horns, the giant
moose filled Roger with a sense of exaltation.
The hunter instinct within the boy set his heart
to beating like a trip-hammer, and his fingers
involuntarily gripped his gun, his first instinct
being to make use of the weapon.</p>

<p>The moose evidently did not suspect their
presence nearby. So far as appearances went,
the big, awkward animal was showing no signs
of alarm.</p>

<p>Roger hastily threw his rifle up to his shoulder,
and, without bothering to take exact aim,
pulled the trigger. He never really knew why
he did not drop the beast as he expected to do.
It might be because this weapon did not compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with his own, which had been carried off
by the treacherous Andrew Waller at the time
the two boys were prisoners of the Dacotahs.</p>

<p>Dick, however, believed that the moose bull
must have made an involuntary movement just
about that time. Roger’s hasty action, or the
glint of the sun on the gun barrel, would be
enough to bring such a thing about.</p>

<p>The one important fact was that, instead of
killing his intended quarry on the spot, Roger
had the chagrin of seeing the animal stumble
and fall, to scramble immediately to his feet
again, and make a vicious plunge forward in
their direction.</p>

<p>Dick of course knew that it was his duty to
get in the fatal shot. He thrust his rifle forward,
and had it not been for an unfortunate
movement on the part of his companion his bullet
would have finished the monster.</p>

<p>In jumping back, however, Roger happened
to knock against the leveled rifle just as his
chum pressed the trigger. The result was a
wasted bullet, and, with both their weapons
empty and useless, a serious outlook faced the
two young hunters.</p>

<p>“Jump to one side!” shouted Dick, realizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that the enraged moose was charging them, with
lowered head, and threatening horns.</p>

<p>Both boys threw themselves back, and in this
manner successfully avoided the passing danger.</p>

<p>They knew that a wounded stag is often a
peril from which even veteran hunters shrink;
and it stood to reason that this enormous animal,
feeling the pain of his injury, would not
run away in a hurry after having made one unsuccessful
charge.</p>

<p>Both boys glanced hastily around, seeking a
tree behind which to ward off an attack. Dick
was fortunate enough to find one close at hand,
but Roger met with his usual ill luck to start
with.</p>

<p>The moose, as though sensing which one of
his enemies had given him that burning injury,
took after Roger, and the boy, hearing the trampling
of his hoofs as he came rushing on, became
a little confused.</p>

<p>“Run, Roger, run faster!” shrilled Dick, who
began to fear for the safety of his cousin.</p>

<p>There were surely grounds for his alarm, for,
just at that moment, Roger caught his foot in
some trailing vine and plunged forward. With
wonderful adroitness, however, the border boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
managed to regain his feet, and face the oncoming
moose bull.</p>

<p>It was too late for him to continue his flight,
and there did not seem to be even time enough
for the boy to scramble out of harm’s way.
Dick’s heart burned within him with fear. He
would have given everything he possessed in
the wide world if just then his gun were only
loaded and primed, ready for use.</p>

<p>Roger, however, saw that there was immediate
need for action, and he took a strange way
of meeting the occasion. Dick, staring at the
scene, saw his chum suddenly leap toward the
oncoming moose bull. He actually flung himself
upon that great, lowered head, falling between
the towering horns, and hastened to clasp his
arms about the animal’s thick neck.</p>

<p>This act plainly greatly astonished the beast,
and he stood stock still for a brief interval.</p>

<p>Dick’s one fear was that the moose should
set off at a lumbering pace through the woods,
and bring up against some tree with such force
as to break the sprawling legs of the clinging
boy. He himself was trying in a confused fashion
to get a charge of powder down the barrel
of his gun, instinct telling him that, once he managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to reload the weapon, the game would be
in his hands.</p>

<p>Now the moose was trying to dislodge Roger
by tossing up his head. Each time he made the
effort Dick held his breath in suspense, for the
boy’s hold was precarious, and might give way
at any moment. It was apparently the intention
of the bull to shake him loose in this way,
and, after the boy dropped back to the ground,
to trample him underfoot before he could recover
sufficiently to get out of the way.</p>

<p>Sometimes strange things happen in cases like
this. The moose must have put an additional
amount of energy into one of his tosses, for Dick
suddenly saw Roger’s form rising several yards
in the air, and crash amidst the leaves of the
tree under which this performance was taking
place.</p>

<p>The moose waited for the fall of his enemy in
order to use those cruel hoofs of his in the final
attack. But, remarkable to say, Roger did not
come down, and Dick suddenly realized that his
nimble chum had taken advantage of his lofty
flight to lay hold of the branches of the tree, and
to cling there as best he could.</p>

<p>Dick felt like giving vent to a shout when he
realized that, so far as Roger was concerned, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
danger could be considered over. He was now
reaching for a patched bullet, and hoped with his
ramrod to push it quickly home on the powder,
when he would be ready, all but the priming, to
make good use of his rifle.</p>

<p>Roger saw what was going on so close by, and
commenced kicking with his feet, and letting out
a few derisive shouts, aimed at the waiting
moose below. He intended to hold the attention
of the bulky animal so Dick could have all
the time he needed to get the gun loaded.</p>

<p>The plan worked splendidly, for the stupid
animal below kept steady vigil under the limb
where all that thrashing was going on. He
snorted with rage, and pawed the earth with
one of his hoofs, as if giving an earnest example
of what he meant to do when the strange enemy
dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>There was nothing to hinder Dick from completing
his loading, and, as he shook the priming
powder into the pan and prepared to fire, he
felt sorry only for one thing. This was the fact
that Roger could not be the one to bring about
the death of the kingly moose, since his heart
seemed to have been so set on accomplishing
such a valorous deed.</p>

<p>It was more because he must save the life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
his chum than through a desire for the death of
the monster moose that caused Dick finally to
pull trigger, after he had found a chance to aim
back of the animal’s foreleg.</p>

<p>The shot was instantly fatal, for those long-barreled
rifles of pioneer days were capable of
sending a bullet with tremendous force. The
big beast fell with a crash, and immediately
afterwards a loud hurrah from Roger announced
that he gloried in the successful outcome
of their adventure.</p>

<p>It was easy enough for the nimble boy to drop
from his perch. He limped a little, and had a
few minor bruises to show for his close contact
with those horns of the bull moose. On the
whole, however, Roger considered that he had
been very lucky. Dick told him that he felt the
same, as they stood beside the fallen monarch
of the forest, and noted his powerful frame and
muscles.</p>

<p>It was impossible to think of taking those towering
horns back with them, since they would
have no way of carrying the trophy save on one
of their horses; and that was utterly out of the
question.</p>

<p>“I feel a little sorry we had to kill the poor
beast,” admitted Dick, “much as any hunter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
might be proud of bringing down such big game.
But his flesh is far too tough for food, and we
can never dream of taking those horns with us.”</p>

<p>“Well, he looked as if he wanted to fight as
soon as he saw us there,” said Roger. “That
was one reason I shot as quickly as I did. But,
while I had most of the fun, the glory remained
for you, Dick.”</p>

<p>“If you call that sort of thing fun, Roger, I
don’t admire your taste, that’s all I can say!
When I saw him rushing at you with his head
lowered I felt a cold chill run up and down my
back, for I thought you were gone.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what made me fasten to his
horns the way I did,” explained Roger, with a
broad grin; “but something seemed to tell me
that was my only chance, and I guess it was,
too.”</p>

<p>“How did you feel when going through the
air?” questioned the other, able to smile now at
the odd spectacle Roger had presented, although
at the time it had seemed a serious thing indeed.</p>

<p>“About as near like flying as I ever expect to
know,” admitted Roger. “And, just as soon as
I found myself in the midst of the branches of
that tree, why something made me take hold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
stick there. I seemed to know the old fellow
was waiting down below to trample me into bits
if I dropped back, and I wasn’t meaning to
oblige him if I could help it.”</p>

<p>“We might manage to chop off one of his
hoofs with our knives to show when we get back
to camp, and prove that we really killed a
moose,” suggested Dick.</p>

<p>“That is a good idea,” agreed his cousin; and
it did not take them long to carry the plan out.
After this they left the spot, and resumed their
hunt, Roger having recovered and loaded his
rifle.</p>

<p>They were a little afraid lest the sound of the
gunshots might have caused any deer happening
to be in the vicinity to take the alarm and flee.
This would be too bad, after setting their hearts
on procuring a supply of fresh meat.</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that the deer did not
know the deadly significance of the firing of a
gun, for within twenty minutes after leaving the
dead bull moose, the boys started a deer, and
Roger this time managed to do himself justice
when he pulled trigger, for the young stag
bounded high in the air to fall in a quivering
heap.</p>

<p>There was ample time to cut the game up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
make their way back to camp with their prize.
Nor did they have the slightest difficulty in gaining
the spot where the expedition had planned to
spend the coming night, thanks to Dick’s way of
keeping his bearings when on a hunt.</p>

<p>These little side excursions were always in
great favor with the two boys. In carrying
them out they were really killing two birds with
one stone; for they not only saw considerable of
the country, and met with adventures that
pleased their love of action, but at the same time
they were able to keep the camp well supplied
with fresh meat.</p>

<p>When they got back on this particular afternoon
they found that there was an Indian in the
camp with whom Captain Lewis was making
terms looking to his serving them as guide until
the lofty mountain range had been crossed. It
was of prime importance that they find that
pass, and cross over at the lowest possible level.
Once the lower ground on the other side was
reached, they could congratulate themselves that
the worst was over.</p>

<p>At the ending of the next day they found themselves
at the actual foot of the mountains, of
which they hoped to commence the ascent with
the advent of another morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>HUNTING THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">How</span> terribly big they seem, towering so
high above us,” Roger remarked to his cousin,
as they stood just outside the camp that evening,
looking upward at the lofty heights that shut
out the sinking sun.</p>

<p>“We have never seen anything like them before,”
admitted Dick, “and I don’t believe there
are mountains back in Old Virginia, that our
fathers talk about so much, that can hold a
candle to these rocky heights.”</p>

<p>“I know for one I’ll be glad when we’ve
crossed the backbone of the ridge, and can see
the sun in the late afternoon again,” Roger went
on to say. “And after that we have the deserts
to cross, if those Indian tales turn out to be
true.”</p>

<p>“I feel more anxious about that stage of our
journey than I do over the dangers we may encounter
in crossing the mountains,” admitted
Dick. “They say men and horses die of thirst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
on those burning sands. I heard Captain Lewis
explaining how we would make skin bags in
order to carry an extra supply of water with us
when we strike the sandy wastes.”</p>

<p>So the talk, as was quite natural, was mostly
of the possible terrors of the journey ahead of
them. Their imagination was given full swing
to picture many of the strange things mentioned
by the roving Indians, though in some cases
these stories turned out to be untrue.</p>

<p>When men had gazed upon such remarkable
wonders as the spouting hot water geysers of
the Yellowstone, they could be easily pardoned
for believing almost anything they heard. This
vast country had never been explored, and it
seemed to be a veritable storehouse of strange
things. (<a id="Note_7r"></a><a href="#Note_7">Note 7</a>.)</p>

<p>The eventful morning came, and seemed to be
favorable for beginning the ascent of the trail
leading over the mountains by way of the pass.
Indian tribes had doubtless made it in crossing
from one part of the country to another. Wild
animals, such as the vast herds of buffaloes, also
had occasion to cross the divide according to the
stages of the weather, and their hoofs had
helped to make the overland trail.</p>

<p>It was a crisp morning in early September.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
In that high altitude the air seemed wonderfully
refreshing, and every one felt capable of the
task that now engaged their attention.</p>

<p>The Indian guide assured them that they need
have no apprehensions regarding the passage of
the mountains, for he would lead them across as
his people had come on many an occasion.</p>

<p>By the time noon came they had mounted far
enough to have a splendid view of the plateau
over which their journey for the last few days
had been made. It was well worth seeing, and
many times did the travelers glance backward
over that extended vista, with longing thoughts
concerning the loved ones who, far away toward
the east, awaited word of their homecoming.</p>

<p>Roger had not forgotten what he had heard
about those strange sheep of the mountains,
with their great curved horns. He was very
eager to discover whether the tales the Indians
told could be true or not, and many a look did he
bend on the crags above them in hope of discovering
a herd of the bighorns.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the afternoon, and
in company with Dick he was riding at some
little distance ahead of the main company,
when Roger actually discovered the object he
sought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/i253.jpg" width="316" height="500" alt="boyson horses looking across canyon at figureson other side" />
<div class="caption">“‘THERE! YOU CAN SEE HIM MOVE’”</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, look, Dick! Tell me! is that one of
those sheep of the mountains up there on that
little patch of grass? There! you can see him
move. He sees us, but believes himself so secure
that he doesn’t bother to run away.”</p>

<p>“It must be what you say, Roger, for I can
see the horns they told us about, which curve
backward from his head. There, another has
come around that spur of rock. I think there
must be a small flock of them up there.”</p>

<p>“But just look at the horns on that buck,
Dick; how I would like to be able to get that pair
to carry back with me.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’d find it a hard job to get
within shooting distance of them,” Dick observed,
“for you can see that they seem to be on
a little shelf where that grass grows, and from
here I can discover no way of reaching it, except
to jump a chasm.”</p>

<p>“Still, there must be some connection above
us, Dick, and I’ve got a good notion to try it, if
only you’ll take charge of my horse.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can plainly see you will never be
happy until you have made your attempt,” Dick
told him, “and so I suppose I’ll have to do as
you ask. But promise me to be careful where
you trust yourself, Roger. Remember, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
you are no mountain goat, and that a fall from
such a height would mean your finish.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I promise you to be as cautious as
though my name were Dick instead of Roger.
All I want to find out is whether I can get to a
place where my gun will send a bullet fair and
square. The moose fell to you, Dick, and I
think I ought to have my chance at these wonderful
jumpers of the mountains.”</p>

<p>“While you’re gone, Roger, I can stop here
and watch what happens. If you do shoot, and
frighten the herd, it may be I can see them do
some of those wonderful things we’ve heard
about, and not half believed. But watch your
steps, Roger.”</p>

<p>Eager to discover if there was any way for
him to get a shot at the feeding sheep, Roger
hastened away. The last Dick saw of him, he
was climbing the side of the mountain, stooping
over as he went so that he might not be seen by
the game he intended to stalk.</p>

<p>For some reason the party had halted below,
and did not come along when Dick expected
them. This might be fortunate for Roger, since
it would keep the sheep from being startled by
the appearance of numerous mounted men.</p>

<p>Watching the feeding animals, Dick could now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
count five in all. The one with the largest horns
he imagined to be the patriarch of the flock; and
he could easily guess that, if Roger found a
chance to shoot, his eyes would fasten upon this
prize beast, for the amazing curved horns had
evidently fascinated the young hunter.</p>

<p>As time crept past Dick wondered how his
cousin was progressing. Surely, by now, he
must have been able to get within easy range of
the unsuspicious sheep, and could pick out his
quarry, if he really meant to shoot. A good
deal would depend on whether Roger believed he
could retrieve his game in case he shot it. If the
poor beast had to lie on the little, grass-covered,
slanting plateau Dick did not believe his chum
would waste a load, merely for the sake of killing.</p>

<p>Once or twice he could see the owner of those
massive horns raise his head and sniff the air
suspiciously. He even ran a few steps, as
though tempted to give the note of alarm that
would send them all plunging downward from
the exposed point of pasturage; but, on second
thought, resisted the temptation.</p>

<p>It may have been sheer pride in his ability to
shield his flock from all harm that caused the
buck to refrain from flight. Undoubtedly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
felt secure upon that plateau, and, even should
any peril suddenly threaten, no animal dared
follow where he and his family could plunge
headlong.</p>

<p>It cost him dearly to indulge in any such proud
boast. The two-legged creature that was crawling
up the face of the rocks possessed a reach
far in excess of any mountain lion or panther
that ever tried to make a meal of a tender ewe—that
stick he carried could bridge a chasm when
it spat out flame and smoke, and carry death in
its wake.</p>

<p>Dick was getting impatient for something to
happen. If Roger had learned that it was useless
for him to try to get a shot, he should be
coming back by now, and not taking any chances.</p>

<p>Just then there came the report of a rifle.
The echoes were flung back and forth among the
spurs of the mountains in a weird manner, but
Dick paid no attention to this fact, being too
busy watching what took place up on that elevated
plateau.</p>

<p>He saw the patriarch of the flock give a leap
into the air, and then fall over, roll several times,
and finally vanish from sight, possibly falling
into some crevice that was not visible to Dick’s
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>But an even more remarkable thing was happening
than the death of the guardian of the
flock. The remainder of the sheep showed
symptoms of alarm. A veritable panic seemed
to have struck them, as, rushing pell mell down
the slope, they, one after another, sprang boldly
out into space.</p>

<p>Holding his very breath with awe, Dick saw
them strike upon their horns on the rocks below,
and, apparently uninjured, continue their headlong
flight. Then, after all, the amazing stories
they had heard from the Indians were true.
Dick felt well repaid for having stood so long,
holding the horses and watching.</p>

<p>He believed he had heard Roger’s shrill cry
of triumph, though he saw nothing of his chum,
look as he might.</p>

<p>When a little time had passed Dick began to
grow somewhat anxious. He wondered if any
harm could have come to Roger, or was the other
trying to get to the fallen sheep that had slipped
into a crevice among the rocks?</p>

<p>Finally Dick could stand it no longer. He decided
to secure the two horses somewhere and
follow the route Roger had taken. Once up
above, he ought to be able to get some news of
the missing one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>He was soon climbing up the face of the rocky
mountain. It was no easy task, and that Roger
had accomplished it without alarming the
quarry was greatly to his credit. Still, there
was no sign of him whom Dick wanted to see.</p>

<p>Dick, with the eye of a born hunter, found it
easy to figure out just how Roger had proceeded.
He did this by putting himself in the place of the
other, and arranging his own plan of campaign.</p>

<p>Now and then he came across signs that told
him he was on the right track. Once it was a
bruised weed, which Roger must have crushed
under his foot; then again it would turn out to
be a piece of loose stone that he could see had
only recently been cast adrift from its former
anchorage.</p>

<p>Little things like this, that might pass unnoticed
by any one not a woodsman, were to this
pioneer boy as the printed words on a page to
one who attends school. They told him the
story just as positively as though with his own
eyes he saw Roger creeping along over that very
spot, taking advantage of this protruding knob
to place his foot upon it, and using that stubby
bush to draw himself up to some new hold above.</p>

<p>By degrees Dick pushed on. He knew he
must be getting very close to where the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
had been when he fired the fatal shot, and still
he saw no signs of Roger.</p>

<p>When he finally arrived at a place where further
progress was impossible, without disclosing
himself to the eyes of the sheep, provided
they still grazed there on the grassy slope beyond,
Dick knew he had reached the spot where
his chum must have lain as he took careful aim
and pressed the trigger.</p>

<p>Then afterwards he must have pressed on,
seeking to reach the bighorn, fallen into the
crevice.</p>

<p>Dick crept on.</p>

<p>He was beginning to feel a strange sense of
impending evil. He feared that something terrible
had happened to Roger, and the possibility
of losing the chum whom he loved so well was
enough to frighten him.</p>

<p>A minute later he came upon the gun. It had
been carefully laid aside, he could see, which, at
least, was evidence that up to then Roger had not
found himself in any difficulty.</p>

<p>Looking beyond, Dick shuddered, for he had
glimpsed what appeared to be a terrible gulf,
at the end of the slope down which Roger must
have made his way. If he had in some manner
lost his footing, and taken that plunge, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
almost a certainty that it was all over with him.</p>

<p>When Dick discovered from the signs that
some one had been scrambling wildly over that
smooth rock his heart misgave him; and it was
with a great fear that he carefully pressed on
until he reached the brink of the chasm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>ON THE BURNING DESERT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner had Dick gained this point than he
gave a whoop. It was a sound that Roger would
recognize if he were living, and capable of giving
back any sort of reply.</p>

<p>Dick’s heart seemed to cease beating for the
moment, such was the agony of suspense that
gripped his whole being. Then, when he caught
a return whoop, he knew his chum was at least
alive.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Roger?” he called, unable to
see anything of the boy, although a little way
down the sheer slope he caught sight of the dead
sheep, just where it had fallen, after slipping
over the edge of the opposite grassy plateau.</p>

<p>“Down below here, making my way to the
game,” came the reassuring answer.</p>

<p>“Are you badly hurt?” demanded Dick.</p>

<p>“Nothing that counts for much; and I’m
bound to get my sheep, now I’m in the hole.
You can’t really blame me, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that now,” the one above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
told him; “but do you know how you are ever
going to get up out of that place again?”</p>

<p>“There’s only one way that I can see, Dick—you
must go back, and, when the men come
along, borrow that rope Jasper Williams always
carries with him. Perhaps he will come back
with you, and help drag me up—after I’ve saved
the horns.”</p>

<p>Knowing how determined Roger could be,
once he had set his mind on a thing, Dick did not
attempt to argue with him, though he believed
the other was taking advantage of his position.</p>

<p>“Now I can see you, Roger, and, by the way
you are advancing along the bottom of the
crevice, I reckon you must be all right. Yes, I
will go back and get the rope. Perhaps some
of the men may want to try mutton for their supper
to-night, and, if so, they can haul the carcass
of your sheep up out of the hole.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to be ready for you when you come
back,” called Roger, waving his hunting-knife
toward his chum; for by that time he had
reached the spot where his quarry lay, and was
evidently in a big hurry to set to work upon the
pair of wonderful, massive horns.</p>

<p>Dick went back over the rocky trail until he
reached the pass, where he found the two horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
just as he had left them. Voices close at hand
gave the welcome news that the other members
of the exploring party were approaching; and,
even as he looked, the foremost came in sight
around a bend in the pass.</p>

<p>The men were greatly interested when they
learned that Roger had actually shot a specimen
of the mountain sheep of which they had heard
the Indians talk. There was no lack of willing
recruits when Dick once more climbed the bank,
and started toward the place where he had left
his chum.</p>

<p>Jasper Williams was one of the three men who
insisted on accompanying Dick, and of course he
carried with him the long, tough rope which had
more than once on the journey proved to be
worth its weight in silver, as for instance, when
it came to hauling the batteaux up some rapids
in the river.</p>

<p>When they reached the abrupt slope, down
which Roger had managed to slip, one of the
men came very near doing the same thing.
Only for the timely assistance given by Jasper
Williams, they might have had two comrades to
haul up from the depths; and the man, being
heavier, might not have escaped so luckily as
the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger had worked fast, and succeeded in cutting
loose the curving horns that had given the
old ram such a majestic appearance. He insisted
on sending these up the first time the rope
came down. Then, at the suggestion of Williams,
he next attached the carcass of the sheep,
which was also safely hauled up.</p>

<p>Last of all Roger himself came up. He had
some minor bruises as the result of his fall, but
he bravely stood the pain, and was proud of his
recent feat.</p>

<p>Great was the wonder and admiration of Captain
Lewis and Captain Clark when they set eyes
on their first Rocky Mountain sheep. It was extremely
doubtful if any white man had, up to
that time, ever beheld a specimen of the <i>genus</i>.
They could hardly blame Roger for wanting to
carry the weighty horns along with him, though
doubting the wisdom of such a course.</p>

<p>Dick, after considerable argument, finally convinced
his cousin that it would be very foolish
to burden his horse after that fashion, when, in
crossing those desert lands, they had heard so
much about, he would be compelled to carry a
supply of water.</p>

<p>“The captain assures me the chances are
three to one we will come back by this same pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
over the mountains, and why not cache the horns
somewhere? Nothing is apt to hurt them, and,
once on the way toward the river, it will be
easy to carry them with you. Then, when we
again get aboard the boats, your troubles will
be over.”</p>

<p>Roger was not altogether unreasonable. This
sort of logic convinced him that most of the
others in the party would consider him foolish
if he persisted.</p>

<p>In the end the horns were placed securely in
a niche in the rocks where they were not likely
to be disturbed by any prowling wild beast.
The spot was marked so it could be easily found
again; and after this had been done Roger felt
relieved.</p>

<p>When they came to cook some of the sheep and
test its worth as food no one was wildly enthusiastic
over it. In fact they pronounced it
tough; though admitting that a young specimen
might prove altogether different.</p>

<p>Roger was even instructed to remember this
in case he ever had another opportunity to procure
fresh mutton; and, having already secured
the desired horns, he readily promised to keep
the advice in mind.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that another chance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the mountain sheep never came his way. In two
more days the expedition had crossed the great
divide, and found that, when the sun went down,
they could see far away toward a level horizon.</p>

<p>Remembering all the dismal tales related by
the superstitious Indians of sandy wastes where
only a sparse vegetation grew, the men began
to feel a new anxiety. Just how far away the
goal they were seeking still lay not even the
astute leader, Captain Lewis, could more than
guess. It might be a hundred miles, and perhaps
many times that; for they had by this time
reached a point where they had nothing to depend
on, save the vague stories told by wandering
Indians whom they happened to meet.</p>

<p>Some of these, however, mentioned a great
body of salty water, the end of which no human
eye could reach, as lying far beyond the hot deserts.
There were also rivers spoken of, where
the great fish swarmed in countless millions, like
the stars in the Milky Way overhead, or the
sands on the shore of the “Big Water.”</p>

<p>Roger hugged these stories to his heart. He
fancied that, once they struck that river of the
mighty game fish, he would be in his glory; for,
if there was one thing above all others Roger
loved to do, it was to fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The time finally came when they found themselves
on the verge of the desert of which they
had heard so much. There could be no such
thing done as pass around the sandy waste, and
their only course was to head straight into the
setting sun.</p>

<p>At the time they had with them an Indian
whom Captain Lewis had succored on the way.
The fellow had fallen and injured his leg so that
he walked with the greatest difficulty, limping
badly. He had lost his bow, and being unable
to provide himself with food, and far from his
home, he stood a good chance of starving to
death.</p>

<p>They had fed him and looked after his injuries.
The Indian professed to be very grateful
for such help, and for several days had clung
to the expedition, though able by then to walk
fairly well.</p>

<p>He had assured them, through signs mostly,
that he could serve them as guide across the hot
waste of sand, as he had himself crossed it on
many occasions. Captain Lewis considered this
a fair return for what he had done. Dick, however,
did not altogether like the Indian’s looks.
He thought he had a crafty way of watching
everything, and that his admiration for some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the horses might lead him to attempting a theft,
unless he were diligently watched.</p>

<p>Still, since the captain seemed to trust him,
Dick did not think it was his duty to say anything.
It might look as though he were inclined
to be bold. At the same time, he made up his
mind that, whenever it was possible, he would
keep an eye on the red man.</p>

<p>That night they filled with water the skin bags
they had by degrees provided for the purpose.
A spring that gurgled close by the camp gave
them an unlimited supply of the necessary fluid;
and they were warned by the guide that it would
be the last waterhole they would expect to come
across for many days.</p>

<p>In the morning the start was made, not without
misgivings. No one could say what terrible
things lay before them, and the men
cast wistful glances back toward that cooling
spring, as though they disliked to say good-by
to it.</p>

<p>That day was one which served to give them a
new experience, for, up to then, few of the explorers
had ever known what it was to travel
over a sandy waste where the sun beat down
with blistering effect, and the air seemed fairly
to quiver with the heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>No living thing had they seen all day long,
save perhaps a skulking small animal, which the
men at first thought to be a dog, though it must
have been a coyote; a few sage hens; and some
gophers, that burrowed in holes in the ground,
from the entrances of which they timidly
watched the horses file slowly past.</p>

<p>In every direction lay cacti of various species
and heights, while thorny plants belonging
to the same family, and bearing a small pear-like
fruit which the Indian told them was edible,
lay upon the ground.</p>

<p>They were glad when night came with its refreshing
air. The camp was made in the open
desert, for there was not a tree of any size in
sight. And it seemed to the boys that, when the
sun went down that evening, it was several times
as large as usual, as well as fiery red. It beckoned
them on just as before, since they knew
well that <i>somewhere</i>, beyond the desert, the sun
must be setting behind the vast ocean which they
all aspired to see.</p>

<p>Another like day followed, and all of them began
to suffer more or less on account of the heat,
and the sand glare, which affected their eyes.
On account of this, it was suggested that hereafter
they rest during the hottest part of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
day, and continue their journey as far into the
night as the horses could stand it.</p>

<p>They seemed to be thirsty most of the time,
and the horses, too, needed many a refreshing
drink in order to continue their labors. More
than one uneasy glance was cast toward the supply
of the precious fluid. If the skin sacks
should spring a leak the wanderers must face a
desperate condition, indeed.</p>

<p>So they settled down for the second night
upon the open desert. Each day would be
very much like another, unless they were unfortunate
enough to experience one of those
dreaded sand storms they had heard about, the
terrors of which they could now easily imagine.</p>

<p>The guide, however, had spoken cheering
words in his own tongue, and, by holding up two
fingers of his hand, gave them to understand
they were by this time half-way across the
desert. If they could stand this for two more
days there was hope that the worst would be
over.</p>

<p>All of them were very tired after that long
day’s traveling, and, since no danger could come
upon them out on the arid waste, sentries were
dispensed with. Dick sat up longer than the
rest, thinking he ought to keep an eye on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
dusky guide; but the Indian appeared to be
soundly sleeping, and weariness finally compelled
the boy to succumb.</p>

<p>The morning came and brought with it a very
disagreeable surprise. At some time during the
night the sorely tempted Indian guide, forgetting
his obligations to Captain Lewis, had taken
an extra horse they had along and started on the
back trail; not only that, but he had also carried
off considerable of their supply of water, leaving
the adventurers face to face with a terrible
calamity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>THE OASIS</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I’m</span> sorry now I allowed myself to go to sleep
at all,” said Dick, as he heard what had happened.</p>

<p>This was the first Roger knew of his suspicions,
for Dick had felt that it was hardly
worth while taking his chum into his confidence.</p>

<p>“Do you mean you didn’t like the way that Indian
acted, and that you meant to stay awake to
keep an eye on him?” demanded Roger.</p>

<p>“I did at first, but I was very tired, and he
seemed to be sound asleep; so I gave it up.
Perhaps, if I had kept awake for just another
half hour, I might have caught him in the act.”</p>

<p>All of them were feeling depressed over the
incident. It was not so much the horse they regretted,
though the animal might prove valuable
to them later on; but having their supply of
drinking water cut short told heavily.</p>

<p>They started on with heavy hearts, and the
future looked dismal, indeed. Still, it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the nature of such a man as Captain Lewis to despair
when, after all, there might be no occasion
for trouble. His good nature presently infected
the remainder of the party, and hope again
found lodgment in their hearts.</p>

<p>By being careful, the water could easily be
made to cover two days, and by that time it was
believed they would have found a fresh supply.</p>

<p>It had been only recently that the two boys had
learned certain facts that gave them considerable
cause for worry. One of the trappers, who
had been out hunting just before the caravan
reached the foot of the mountains, had discovered
two men who wore the garb of whites.</p>

<p>They were armed with guns and had horses in
the bargain. He had not been able to creep
close enough to hear anything they said, but,
from the description which he gave of the
strangers, both Dick and Roger felt sure they
knew who they must be.</p>

<p>The one with the black hair and beard was the
vindictive French trader, François Lascelles;
while his companion could be no other than the
treacherous Andrew Waller, who had been
kicked out of the camp when his duplicity became
known.</p>

<p>The two rascals had evidently joined forces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and continued to follow after the explorers, bent
on having a sweet revenge for the indignities
that had been visited upon their heads, though
rightly, by Captain Lewis.</p>

<p>Alexis, the grown son of Lascelles, must have
returned to civilization, since he had not been
seen with his father. The knowledge that these
evil men were bent on following them across
mountain and plain, and determined on punishing
the boys because their plans had been ruined,
was something calculated to take away much of
the pleasure Dick and Roger would otherwise
have enjoyed.</p>

<p>From time to time their thoughts naturally
went out toward Lascelles and his unscrupulous
ally. They often wondered whether the two
men had actually crossed the mountain range,
and if they would even attempt the passage of
this burning desert.</p>

<p>Roger in particular was indignant over the
prospect of such a thing.</p>

<p>“It would serve them right,” he declared, as
he talked matters over with Dick, “if they lost
their way out here on the desert, and paid the
penalty with their miserable lives. I wish that
would happen to them, even if it does sound
wicked; but of what use are they in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
except to bring trouble to others who never tried
to harm them in the beginning?”</p>

<p>“And the chances are,” pursued Dick, frowning,
“that, after we do get across this sandy
stretch, if they follow us, it will be to spread
some of the same lies about our being the sons
of the Great White Father at Washington.
They plan to have the Indians seize us, and hold
us for the ransom that would never come. It
might mean we would be kept all our lives
among the Indians, and never see our families
any more.”</p>

<p>“All I can say, Dick, is that I’ll be a happy
boy when we get across this terrible desert.
When we happen on the white bones of animals
that have perished here, sticking out of the sand,
they make me think of finger posts pointing to
our finish. To tell you the honest truth, I don’t
think I have ever shivered before when burning
up with fever; but it’s the prospect that does
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s no use feeling that way,” Dick
assured him, seeing that really the other was
very much depressed in his spirits; “we are going
to pull out of this scrape, just as we always
do. Before a great while things will look cheery
again, take my word for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“If only there was any chance to find game
I wouldn’t feel so bad,” complained Roger,
touching his gun, which was fastened behind his
saddle.</p>

<p>“Well, there is a little patch of scrub trees beyond
us right now,” his comrade told him.
“Suppose we ride ahead and see if we are lucky
enough to find a stray antelope there. Sometimes
there is moisture in one of those oasis,
and some grass manages to grow. It can do no
harm, and will serve to take our minds off a disagreeable
subject.”</p>

<p>Roger began to show a little animation at that.
Anything touching on hunting was apt to engage
his attention, and raise his spirits.</p>

<p>“I’m with you, Dick, every time!” he
hastened to exclaim; “and, if we could only
strike a deer, even one of those little antelopes
you spoke of, it would be worth while. Our
fresh meat has given out, but we could find
plenty of wood to make a fire if we needed it.
That sun, though, is hot enough to cook meat by
itself, I think.”</p>

<p>After mentioning their plan to Captain Clark,
who was nearby, the two lads urged their horses
to increase their slow pace. This the jaded animals
were not much inclined to do, but the will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of their masters prevailed, and they left the
plodding caravan behind.</p>

<p>Dick suggested that they divide their forces,
in order to approach the patch of scrubby-looking
dwarf trees from two sides. This was the
policy of an experienced hunter. In case there
happened to be anything worth shooting among
the trees, the hunters stood a double chance of
getting a shot, no matter which way the deer
ran.</p>

<p>Dick did not entertain much hope of meeting
with success. From the look of the miserable
timber he felt it was hardly probable that grass
was growing in its midst, or that a deer should
have been attracted by the promise of food.
Still, it would not do to neglect any precaution;
and, as he rode forward, he held his gun ready
in his hand, meaning to jump to the ground before
firing, so as to be more certain in his aim.</p>

<p>When he had reason to believe that Roger
must have come up on the opposite side of the
patch of trees, Dick felt that it was time to turn
his horse’s head, and ride directly toward his
goal.</p>

<p>Just then he caught some sort of movement
amidst the trees, though he could not tell the nature
of it. Some living creature must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
sought refuge there, though it might after all
prove to be only a lone buzzard, pecking at a
bone, or perhaps one of those larger birds which
Captain Lewis had told them were vultures.</p>

<p>He kept watching the spot as his horse advanced.
The animal snorted once or twice,
which Dick considered a sign worth noticing, for
it might mean that some ferocious beast lay concealed
on the border of the oasis.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards Dick gave vent to a
grunt of disgust. After all, it turned out to be a
sneaking wolf of that small species which they
had found to be as cowardly as it was ugly.
Yes, now he had a good glimpse of the animal,
running along the edge of the timber, and evidently
expecting to make off in the other direction.</p>

<p>Dick hoped Roger would not be tempted to
waste a shot on the cowardly beast, for its death
could not be of the least advantage to them.
It’s presence there settled the last lingering
hope he had felt concerning the finding of game.
No antelope was apt to stay long when one of
those hungry coyotes came around, Dick imagined.</p>

<p>He rode slowly on. The patch of trees was
really larger than he had imagined, and, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
about it, Dick felt he should make doubly sure.
Perhaps they might run on a small spring there
in the oasis, though the appearance of things did
not inspire him with much confidence.</p>

<p>“It would be even better than finding game, if
we did come across a water hole,” he was telling
himself as he pushed on.</p>

<p>He heard Roger give a loud yell on the other
side of the oasis. Evidently he had just discovered
the skulking animal and was shouting to
start him in full flight across the sandy waste.
But he did not shoot, for which Dick was glad.</p>

<p>Now, having arrived at the border of the
scrubby trees, Dick jumped down and fastened
his horse to a convenient branch. It was his intention
to enter the patch of timber on foot, as
Roger was doubtless doing from the other side.
They could scour the whole of it in a brief time,
and find out whether so much as a cup of water
was to be obtained.</p>

<p>He could hear Roger advancing opposite to
him, and knew they would soon meet. Even
then he caught sight of the other moving along,
though evidently hopeless of finding anything in
the shape of game.</p>

<p>Dick had just opened his mouth to say something
when he was thrilled to hear a dreadful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
rattling sound that he knew only too well. At
the same time Roger sprang hastily back, and
uttered a loud cry of alarm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>AMONG THE NEZ PERCES</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Look</span> out, Dick, there are rattlesnakes all
around here. I can see three of them right in
front of you! Get back, Dick, get back, I tell
you!”</p>

<p>Dick hastened to comply, for by that time he
also had detected the presence of the venomous
reptiles. They seemed to be of a small species,
such as can be found on the plains of the entire
West, but their stroke carries just as sure death
as though the snakes were twice the size.</p>

<p>The boys had often come across them of late,
mostly near the colonies of gophers, for the two
seemed to be able to dwell together in harmony,
though possibly the snakes made an occasional
meal from some of the puppies.</p>

<p>Roger had already laid aside his gun, and
picking up a long stick, he commenced to belabor
some of the coiled snakes.</p>

<p>“Think you own the earth do you?” Roger
was saying, as he plied his stick with vigor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
knocked first one snake and then another into a
wriggling mass. “Well, I want to show you
that others besides you have a right to breathe,
and walk where they please. That makes the
fifth one I’ve smashed, Dick. Did you ever see
such a nest of the ‘varmints,’ as Jasper Williams
would call them?”</p>

<p>Roger evidently meant to keep on just as long
as there was a single one of the ugly, scaly creatures
in sight. He certainly had more than
his share of antipathy toward all reptiles, for he
never let an opportunity to kill one escape him.</p>

<p>When he could no longer find anything to hit,
Roger consented to drop the stick, secure his
rifle, and prepare to leave the scrubby timber.
They could find nothing in the way of water,
though there must have been something of the
sort underground to have allowed those ugly
dwarf trees to grow in the first place.</p>

<p>“There goes the silly, little wolf scurrying
off,” said Roger as they mounted once more,
Dick having brought his horse through the patch
of woods. “He must think we set great store
by his dingy hide, and would take after him.
But I’m disappointed because we failed to get
an antelope.”</p>

<p>“Better luck next time, Roger,” his comrade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
told him; for nothing seemed to crush the spirits
of this sanguine lad.</p>

<p>The third day passed, and, as the blazing sun
sank again beyond the glittering horizon, none
of them, even by shading his eyes with his hands,
could see any sign to proclaim that they were
drawing near the end of the desert.</p>

<p>It was not a very cheerful party that sat
around on blankets that night and exchanged
ideas concerning their prospects of pulling
through these difficulties. The horses were
showing signs of the hard usage to which they
had been put. Lack of forage made them
hungry all the time, since the small amount of
hay that could be carried was almost gone.</p>

<p>With the morning they were again on the
way, the sun at their backs. Noon found them
resting, though the journey was resumed later
on. When once more the sun went down its
glow showed them trees in the near distance, the
presence of which they had not been able to detect
before, on account of the shimmer of the
sun’s torrid rays on the shining sand.</p>

<p>It was the consensus of opinion among the
men that they were now close to the western extremity
of the desert, and they decided to keep
on moving far into that night if necessary, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
order to reach the timber that promised them
water, and shelter from the terrible sun.</p>

<p>Before midnight they arrived at the trees and
had hardly made their way among them when
some of the weary men sank to the ground, unable
to continue further. Camp was made on
the spot, and the remainder of the night was
spent in refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>While the desert had been left behind, they
now had a new source of trouble. Water they
could obtain as often as they needed it, but their
food supplies had fallen very low, nor were the
hunters able to find game, though they searched
early and late for signs of deer or bear; anything,
in fact, that could be eaten.</p>

<p>“If this sort of thing keeps on,” Roger
grumbled, when he and Dick were returning
from an unsuccessful search for game, “there’s
only one resort left to us, and that is to feed on
horse flesh. I’d hate to come to it; but, rather
than starve to death, I believe I’d try it.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed at hearing this confession.</p>

<p>“And yet, when we were among the Sioux,”
he remarked merrily, “you threw up your hands
in horror at the thought of eating baked dog,
which the Indians esteem a great delicacy, so
that they seldom have it except when they want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to make a great feast. How do you feel about
that now, Roger?”</p>

<p>“To be honest with you, Dick, I’ve changed
my mind somehow. Those were days when we
always had plenty to eat; but now the rations
have become so scanty that we feel half starved
most of the time. Yes, I believe that if I was
asked to sit down to a feast of baked dog, I’d accept,
and with thanks.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing like hunger to serve as
sauce at a meal,” laughed Dick. “And, when I
tell them at home how you were cured of some
of your nice notions about the kind of food you
long for, they will think it quite a joke.”</p>

<p>“We’re in a bad fix as it goes,” resumed
Roger; “with some of the men half sick from
their sufferings on this long trip, little to eat in
camp, and a slim prospect of getting anything
from now on. Perhaps, after coming so far,
none of us will live to see that wonderful
ocean.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes we shall, never fear,” Dick assured
him. “But stop and look ahead. What have
we run up against now, I wonder. It looks like
an Indian family on the move.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Dick,” cried Roger. “They
have a horse, and two poles fastened so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
other ends drag on the ground. On that they
have hides, and I can see a squaw and a papoose.
Suppose we try and see if we can make
ourselves understood?”</p>

<p>“I mean to,” replied the other, quickly.
“The warrior may be able to direct us to the
river we are seeking, down which we hope to
float until we come to the sea itself.”</p>

<p>They walked nearer the Indians, who by this
time had discovered their presence, and were
undoubtedly amazed to see people with white
skins in that part of the country.</p>

<p>“We have never, up to now, come in contact
with any Indians dressed as that fellow is,” remarked
Dick, as he held up his hand with the
palm toward the woman, to indicate that their
intentions were friendly; for that seems to be a
sign universally understood among all the savage
peoples of the world.</p>

<p>“It may be they belong to the Nez Perces
tribe, and the man is a brave, because he wears
the bear claws about his neck,” (<a id="Note_8r"></a><a href="#Note_8">Note 8</a>) suggested
Roger; “I heard Captain Clark speaking
about them only yesterday, and saying we must
soon strike their hunting grounds, for he had
learned about them from other tribes.”</p>

<p>As the two boys joined the Indians they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that the fat squaw had a small papoose in her
arms. Dick instantly discovered that the child
was suffering in some way, possibly from
cramps in its little stomach. According to the
native custom nothing would be done to relieve
the pain, that is in the way of medicine. When
they reached their village the old medicine man
would doubtless be called in to conduct his eccentric
dances around the writhing child, to
rattle his hollow gourds that contained small
stones, and to do everything in his power to
frighten off the evil spirit that was believed to be
tormenting the papoose.</p>

<p>Dick tried to begin a conversation with the
brave. As he could depend only on gestures it
was rather difficult; but, by this time, both boys
were becoming more or less expert in this sort
of thing. Presently he managed to convince the
brave that he was a medicine man after a
fashion, and would be glad to try to relieve the
sufferings of the papoose.</p>

<p>When the squaw understood this from what
her man told her, she looked dubious. Evidently
her faith had made her believe that the
more fantastic the costume of the healer, the
better chance there would be of success; and how
then could this boy with the white skin frighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
away the evil spirit when he made no attempt to
disguise himself?</p>

<p>Both brave and squaw looked anxiously on as
Dick took out a little case from his pocket and
extracted a tiny bottle. It was only camphor
that the phial contained, but Dick felt positive it
would work wonders, if only he could get the
child to swallow a dose.</p>

<p>This was finally managed with the help of the
squaw. Since they had consented to allow the
“paleface wizard” to try to charm the evil spirit
out of the papoose, she meant that the experiment
should be carried out regardless of the
child’s whims; and so with her finger she thrust
the medicine down the little one’s throat.</p>

<p>Dick then went on to talk with his fingers. He
was trying to find out whether the village of the
brave was nearby, and finally succeeded in learning
they would come upon it in one day’s walk,
or the sweep of the sun from the east to the
west.</p>

<p>From what the other said in his native fashion
Dick was not quite sure about its position. He
cut a piece of bark from a tree and held it out
to the Nez Perces brave, together with a nail,
showing him how to mark upon the smooth surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Apparently the Indian was shrewd enough to
grasp his meaning, for he immediately commenced
to make crude figures. Roger watched
his efforts with growing eagerness.</p>

<p>“I do believe he’s caught what you’ve been
trying to say to him, Dick!” he exclaimed in
glee. “See there now! he’s gone and made a lot
of cone-shaped things that I’m sure must stand
for wigwams. That’s meant for his village;
and now he’s making a wriggly line past it. Do
you think that can stand for a river?”</p>

<p>“No question but that it does, Roger. There,
now he makes a broader line of the same kind,
which must mean a big river that the first one
flows into.”</p>

<p>“Watch him now, Dick; what does he mean by
all that curly stuff? To me it looks like waves
rolling up onto the beach, just as we’ve seen
them at that lake near which we passed the winter
on the Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>“I really believe he means that the broad river
empties into the sea!” announced Dick, at which
Roger could hardly repress his feelings of exultation.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” he cried, “we have struck something
worth while at last, if only we can coax
this brave to go to camp with us. And Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
your medicine has worked wonders already, for
the papoose seems to be kicking no longer. I
guess the cramps have been settled.”</p>

<p>The squaw beamed on them now. She was
evidently awed by the wonderful success of the
“paleface medicine man,” who found no necessity
for indulging in fantastic dances and such
things, but chased the evil spirit out by simply
sending a message down the child’s throat that
he must vacate!</p>

<p>Again Dick endeavored to tell the brave that,
if they would accompany the boys to where they
had companions, all of them on the following
day would go to the Nez Perces village with the
Indians, and enjoy the hospitality of the red
men.</p>

<p>It ended in the others accepting, so that, half
an hour later, they reached the camp, where
their coming created no end of excitement; for
every one expected it would soon lead to great
things.</p>

<p>If the boys had failed to secure any game in
this, their last hunt, at least they had accomplished
what was better; for, with the new prospects
ahead of them, it began to look as though
their troubles might all be in the past.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis spent almost two hours in sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
talk with the Indian that evening, after they
had smoked the peace pipe between them. Together
with what he was able to pick up, and the
crude map fashioned by the brave on the smooth
bark, he felt convinced that they would soon arrive
at a river that eventually emptied into the
great ocean which they had traveled thousands
of miles to gaze upon.</p>

<p>No longer were the weary explorers given
over to hopelessness, as had begun to be the case
of late. The future began to assume a rosy hue,
and both boys felt certain the success that had
been dangling before them as a tempting bait all
these long months was about to become a certainty.</p>

<p>When morning came they once more set forth,
but now laughter was the rule instead of silence
and long faces. The brave and his squaw had
by degrees overcome their feeling of awe, and
were quite friendly with the men.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Dick to Roger, as they rode
slowly on, “I heard him trying to explain to the
captain that his chief and most of the men in the
village would be away at this time, for they expected
to start on a big hunt, to lay in a store of
jerked meat for the winter season. But that
will not make any difference. He says his people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
will welcome us, especially after they know
what a great medicine man is coming.”</p>

<p>At that both boys laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“If you are wise,” said Roger, “you will get
ready to do a big business, because every old
squaw that has an aching tooth will call upon
you to chase the demon of pain away.”</p>

<p>“Oh! very well,” replied Dick, carrying his
honors easily, “I’ll draw out the aching molars,
and in that way bring freedom from pain. But
all of us will be glad to rest for a while in the
Nez Perces village.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger. “And, moreover, we
hope they will be free with their food, because
our stock has by this time got down to nearly
nothing. For once I think I could enjoy some
Indian cooking.”</p>

<p>“Even if it has to be a feast of baked dog!”
added Dick, at which the other made a grimace,
though he immediately replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, even that, if the rest of you try it. I
don’t hold myself to be any better than my comrades,
and what they can stand I ought to. Perhaps,
who knows, all of us may yet take a great
liking for the dish. The first man who ever
swallowed a raw oyster must have had a strong
stomach, I should say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Late that afternoon they came upon the Nez
Perces village, which they found located upon
quite a noble river. This stream the explorers
immediately called the Lewis River in honor of
their intrepid leader. Sad to say in later years
this well-earned name was changed to that of
Snake River, showing what short memories
those who came after must have had, in forgetting
how much they were indebted to Captain
Meriwether Lewis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>FROM SADDLE TO CANOE AGAIN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was soon planned that a short stop should
be made here, in order to recuperate to some extent
after their recent strenuous experiences.
A number of the men had become ill through
long exposure to the burning sun, and the lack
of proper food. Captain Lewis hoped to have
them in good shape presently, so that they could
start forth upon the last dash for the Pacific
Coast.</p>

<p>Besides, the chief being absent, there was
really no one of authority in the Nez Perces
village with whom to deal; and just then the explorers
wished to make a covenant, or bargain.</p>

<p>From now on they could make much better use
of boats than of horses, and it was hoped to effect
an arrangement with the Nez Perces chieftain
to care for the animals they owned through
the coming winter. Then, the adventurers
hoped to borrow canoes and to finish the long
journey by the water. When, in the spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
they returned that way, they could change back,
and reward the friendly Indians for taking care
of the horses, which would, of course, be needed
again in crossing to the mountains.</p>

<p>Several pleasant days in September passed
away, while the members of the expedition
waxed hale and hearty again. They had plenty
to eat, and even made out to secure an amount of
food from the Indians to last them for some time
ahead, in case game proved to be scarce.</p>

<p>No one anticipated such a thing, however,
because from all reports they judged there was
great hunting along the lower river that emptied
into the sea; Then there was the multitude of
splendid fishes, the flesh of which they were
told resembled that of the mountain trout.</p>

<p>These the travelers had already classified as
salmon, because Captain Lewis had seen that
noble game fish caught in Maine and Canada,
where it came in fresh from the ocean to spawn
in the headwaters of the rivers.</p>

<p>Many were the stories the Nez Perces told, in
their sign language mostly, about the Indians
who frequented the lower reaches of this broad
river, where the “shining fish” swarmed at
times so that no man could count their number,
which was like the grains of sand on the beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>As near as the boys could make out these natives,
from some peculiarity connected with
their person, were known far and wide as the
Flat Heads. They seemed to be of an exceedingly
warlike disposition, and great hunters, as
well as persistent fishermen.</p>

<p>Their method of taking the salmon was with
a spear, and in the season an adept could daily
throw up on the bank a glittering pile of the big
fish calculated, when dried after a manner in
vogue among them, to last his lodge all winter.</p>

<p>Many were the interesting things the boys
learned when they found a means of talking
with the peaceful Nez Perces. The days passed
almost too quickly for even Roger, impatient as
he was to set eyes on the goal of their hopes.</p>

<p>And, just as had been anticipated, the fame
of Dick as a “big medicine” spread through all
the skin lodges of the tribe. People even came
from other settlements to consult the “wonder
boy,” who could chase the evil spirits out of a
suffering body by simply sending down a pill to
wrestle with the monster.</p>

<p>Dick had his hands full, much to the amusement
of his cousin. He did not shirk his duty,
though careful not to utterly exhaust his precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
store of drugs, compounded for the most
part by his mother’s own hands.</p>

<p>The head chief finally returned, and with him
the band of warriors who had been on the grand
hunt. They brought back with them a large
store of fresh meat, which the squaws immediately
set to work to dry after their crude fashion,
thus converting it into “pemmican,” black,
tough stuff which made the boys shudder to look
at, but which could sustain the human frame
wonderfully.</p>

<p>Success having attended the annual hunt, the
chief was in a particularly good humor. He
felt that the coming of these “palefaces” must
have had something to do with the bountiful
supply of game he and his warriors had come
across.</p>

<p>Besides, the whites intended going down into
the country of the dreaded Flat Heads, and their
influence might be exerted to make peace between
those Indians and the Nez Perces. So a
feast was spread, at which all of the whites had
the pleasure of tasting baked dog, which they
agreed was fair eating, though none of them
came back for a second helping.</p>

<p>The chief readily entered into a covenant
whereby, for a certain consideration, he agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to care for the horses of the whites until they
came up the river in the spring, upon which the
animals were to be returned to their owners.</p>

<p>Besides this, canoes were loaned to the “palefaces,”
boats made of skin, and a little insecure,
but nevertheless serviceable for the purposes of
the explorers.</p>

<p>“Do you think the chief will keep his word
about the horses, Dick?” asked Roger, after
they had heard of the arrangement between the
two captains and the head men of the tribe, after
passing the pipe solemnly around the circle at
the council fire.</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel sure he will,” Dick replied. “I
like his looks, and in nearly every case the word
of an Indian, once given, is better than the bond
of many white men.”</p>

<p>“But you remember how that false guide deceived
us in the desert, and ran away with one
of our horses?” objected Roger.</p>

<p>“There never was a rule that did not have an
exception,” Roger was told. “Now and then
you may find a red man who dishonors his word,
but in the main they would sooner be torn to
pieces than betray a trust. We shall see our
horses when we come back this way, Roger, if
we are so lucky as to be able to return.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then there was that news we had about
those two white men who were seen by a Nez
Perces hunter far down the river,” said Roger,
uneasily. “They were in a canoe, and had evidently
passed the village in the nighttime, unseen.
At the time the Nez Perces saw them they
were dickering with some of the Flat Heads,
as though meaning to make allies of those fighters.”</p>

<p>“It sounds as if we might be in for another
lot of trouble, before we reach the end of our
voyage,” admitted Dick.</p>

<p>“Then you agree with me, Dick, that those
two men must be our bitter foes, François
Lascelles and Andrew Waller?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sorry to say they must be those
men and no others. But, Roger, something
seems to tell me that we may not be bothered
much longer by their dark plotting. They are
apt to overdo the matter, and perhaps be slain
by the very power they set in motion to destroy
us.”</p>

<p>“You mean the fighting Flat Heads may
turn on them, sooner or later; is that it, Dick?”
asked Roger, eagerly.</p>

<p>“That is a fate which has overtaken many
such schemers,” came the answer. “Unscrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
men often start fires that, in the end, consume
them. My father has told me that many
a time. We have been preserved through all
our adventures, and for one I can face the future
without flinching. I do not believe it will be our
fate to die at the hands of such rascals as those
men are.”</p>

<p>It was on the following day after this talk between
the two chums that, all preparations having
been completed, the little party embarked
for the last lap of their long trip, which in the
case of Captain Lewis meant from coast to
coast.</p>

<p>The friendly Nez Perces gave them a good
send-off. There were even some whoops, and
waving of hands, after the whites had pushed off
from the shore.</p>

<p>Perhaps of all the party Dick would be most
missed. His numerous patients would mourn
the absence of the “big medicine,” should there
be a return of their maladies later on. Perhaps
they feared that the Evil Spirit might venture to
take double toll on account of the serious setback
received during the presence in their midst
of the “wonder doctor.”</p>

<p>“And one thing sure,” Roger told his cousin,
as they worked their paddles industriously to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
keep ahead of the other boats, “you will have
to get to work and make up a new stock of medicine
after the manner you’ve seen your mother
do it; for, when we come back this way in the
spring, if we ever do, there’ll be a crop of ailments
waiting for you to take care of.”</p>

<p>Dick only laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“I was thinking about that myself,” he stated;
“and I believe I could do it, provided we can
find the same kind of herbs growing out here.
But it certainly feels good to me to be in a boat
again, after all that hard work riding a horse
across a hot desert.”</p>

<p>Roger felt the same way, for the boys were
much more at home with a paddle in their hands
than in the saddle. Brought up on the bank of
the Missouri, they had early become adepts on
and in the water, and they spent much of their
time fishing, in order to supply the families with
the food that was needed.</p>

<p>That night they made camp on the bank of the
Lewis. They were surrounded by the great
trees that have since then made Oregon and
Washington forests famous; and all this was so
vastly different from their recent experiences
amidst desert sands that it was no wonder every
one’s spirits were buoyant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the boys wanted to take a little turn
around the camp before night set in, hoping to
come across some game. This they could easily
do because, at the time, they had nothing to do
with getting supper ready, as it was not their
turn to serve as cooks.</p>

<p>Once again success came their way, for they
succeeded in starting a buck, and, although it
took a double shot to bring the fleet animal down,
Dick proved equal to the occasion, after Roger’s
bullet seemed to be wasted.</p>

<p>This circumstance seemed to annoy the latter
very much, for he was jealous of his well-earned
reputation as a marksman. It did not surprise
Dick, then, when the other’s first move upon
reaching the fallen buck was to examine eagerly
the quarry.</p>

<p>“I thought it was queer if I missed him entirely,”
declared Roger, with a ring of triumph
in his voice; “you can see where my bullet
passed through his body, but, as luck would have
it, no vital part was touched. I’m glad you
managed to finish him, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so am I for several reasons,” remarked
the other; “in the first place we need the meat.
Then again, it would be too bad for him to run
for miles and in the end drop, and that wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
you gave him would have proved fatal finally.”</p>

<p>Of course the party rejoiced to see a supply
of meat come in. They knew they could depend
on the boys to procure it if there chanced to be
any game in the vicinity; and when they heard
the double shot more than one of the men licked
his lips in full expectation of a treat.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to have a reputation for accomplishing
things, for there are times when
it spurs the possessor on, in order that he may
not lose caste with his admirers.</p>

<p>Roger was not fully satisfied with the shooting
of the buck. His fishing instinct had been
aroused by the tales he had heard concerning the
great finny prizes to be had in these rivers that
ran down to the sea, and he longed to be able to
capture his first prize in the shape of a salmon.</p>

<p>So, immediately after supper, he got his line
in readiness, and set it in hope of a strike.
Many times during the evening he left the vicinity
of the campfire, where the men were sitting
at their ease and exchanging stories, to
make an eager investigation of his line.</p>

<p>Roger was, however, doomed to disappointment
that night. Either the salmon did not run
so far from the sea at this time of the year, or
else his bait had not proven satisfactory. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
time, no doubt, he would learn better; or he
could possibly find a chance to make use of the
spear he had secured from a Nez Perces brave,
and which was used for striking the great fish
as they passed through some narrow estuary of
the river, running between the rocks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>AT THE FALLS OF THE COLUMBIA</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">I hope</span> you don’t think I’m discouraged,
Dick, because so far no fish has come near my
hook?” remarked Roger, when the time came
to wrap their blankets around them and seek
rest.</p>

<p>“Oh! I know you too well to believe that,”
replied the other. “From now on I expect to
see you doing your best to land a prize. Sooner
or later success is bound to come, Roger.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” was the confident way the other
spoke; “because I’ve always made it my business
to stick to the old motto, ‘If at first you
don’t succeed, try, try again.’ And even if the
fish refuse to look at my bait I’ve got that spear,
you remember. One of these days I’ll find a
chance to launch it, and bring up a salmon
worth looking at.”</p>

<p>Dick always liked to hear Roger talk that
way. It was his constancy that in the past had
won him many a battle; for Roger had a stubborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
streak in his nature and would come back
again and again to make new attempts. As the
water by everlasting dripping will wear away a
stone, so this “never-say-die” spirit often won
out in the end.</p>

<p>Nothing disturbed the slumbers of the travelers
during that first night upon the bank of the
Lewis River. They started again early in the
morning, for, now that the end of their journey
was almost in sight, a fever began to possess
them to cover the ground as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>New sights opened up to their gaze with every
mile of progress made. The paddles dipped
into the clear water, and the sunlight, falling on
the drops dripping from the blades, made each
one resemble a glittering diamond.</p>

<p>After their life spent on the muddy Missouri
it was a great pleasure to Dick and Roger to find
themselves upon a stream where they could in
places look down for many feet, and see the
stones on the bottom, so transparent was the
water.</p>

<p>As they floated along, waiting for the others
to catch up with them, the boys’ favorite amusement
was to lie still, and, looking over the gunnel
of their hide canoe, watch the small fishes
darting to and fro; or thrust a paddle at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
clumsy turtle that had come up to see what sort
of object this floating log could be.</p>

<p>It was not always as pleasant as this, however,
for one day they had a downpour of rain
that caused them to make hurriedly for the
shore, and get their tents up with as little delay
as possible.</p>

<p>The storm continued all of the following day,
and an unusual amount of rain for that time
of year descended. After that the water was
not so clear as before, the boys noticed. There
were also places where they discovered landslides
had occurred, sections of the bank having
slipped into the rising river.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing we picked out a camp site
where the ground was firm,” Roger observed, as
they passed such a slide on the next day, and
saw what a terrible thing it had been.</p>

<p>Dick was ready to agree with what his companion
said. He shrugged his broad shoulders
and shook his head.</p>

<p>“It would have proved a bad job for us, I take
it, Roger, if we had been camping on this spot.
Think of having the ground slip from under you
while you sleep; and of awaking to find yourself
struggling in the river. Yes, we were lucky to
be on firm ground while the rain lasted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“The days keep passing along,” mused
Roger, “and so far I haven’t been able to take
a single salmon. And only this morning I’m
sure I saw one jump out of the water after some
sort of insect. If only I knew what kind of fly
it was I might be able to coax one of the big
fish to come to time.”</p>

<p>“It is near the end of October, too,” Dick remarked,
“and any day now Captain Lewis says
he expects that we must reach the lower river.”</p>

<p>“And, after that, all we have to do is to let
the swift current carry us along to the sea; eh,
Dick?”</p>

<p>“Our only remaining danger will come from
the Flat Head Indians who live along the banks
of the broad river. Then we must remember,
you know, Roger, that there is a great fall somewhere
below us. The Nez Perces Indians told
us they make a noise like thunder when the
water is high, as it is after so much rain.”</p>

<p>“Of course we must keep on the watch for the
fall, Dick; I give you my word for it, I have no
desire to be carried over the brink in one of
these frail little hide canoes. It would be
smashed on the rocks below, and, as for us, we
might not know what had happened.”</p>

<p>“Just watch that fish hawk hovering over that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
place in the river, meaning to snatch up his dinner
when he gets ready. There’s the champion
fisher for you, Roger. If that bird could only
talk he could tell you all about the habits of
these wary salmon that so far you haven’t succeeded
in catching.”</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried Roger, excitedly.
“Oh! what a splash he made! And, Dick, look
at him trying to get up again! It’s all he can
do to rise, beating his wings like a crazy thing.
See the fish the fellow has fastened his claws
on, Dick. There goes a salmon, I do believe, the
very first we’ve seen!”</p>

<p>The big fish hawk was indeed having a hard
battle trying to fly with such a large fish in its
talons. It fluttered its wings, and still could
not manage to get more than twenty feet above
the water.</p>

<p>As it turned toward the bank, doubtless meaning
that, if compelled to release its hold on the
glittering prize, the fish should fall upon land
where it could be eaten at leisure, Roger gave
vent to another exclamation.</p>

<p>“When it gets off the river I’m going to shout,
and see if I can frighten the hawk into letting
that fish drop,” he observed, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’ll join with you, then,” agreed his chum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>A few seconds later, Roger made a signal with
his paddle at which both of them gave forth a
startling yell. Surely enough, the sudden discordant
sound startled the fish hawk, and it immediately
let its prize go.</p>

<p>“There, it landed on the bank!” cried Roger.
“Quick! let’s paddle ashore before it flops back
into the river again. Oh! my first salmon seems
to be coming to me from the air after all!”</p>

<p>Reaching the bank, Roger sprang ashore, and
presently came back, carrying his capture by inserting
a finger in the gill. It was indeed a salmon,
though only of a comparatively few pounds
weight, and nothing compared to myriads they
were fated to see later on.</p>

<p>“Enough to make a supper for both the captains,
and ourselves in the bargain!” explained
the triumphant Roger. “And I want to say
that never before did I pull in a fish from the
air. That’s a new way of doing it, Dick. I’ll
never see an industrious fish hawk after
this but that I’ll think of what happened to-day.”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t secured the fish some robber
eagle might,” declared Dick. “Many a time
have I sat and watched one of those bald-headed
pirates, perched on a dead limb of a tree, too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
lazy to pounce down and get a dinner for himself,
and only waiting until a hawk flew off with
its prize, when, after the other bird, would start
the eagle, and ten times out of eleven he was
bound to play the robber game.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Roger, “I’ve seen the poor
hawk mount high in the air, trying to escape;
but with the eagle in hot pursuit. In the end
the fish would drop, and the eagle follow after
it, snatching his dinner from the air long before
it could strike the earth; just as I can let a stone
fall, and then overtake it with my hand before
it lands.”</p>

<p>It was on the second day after this incident
that the boys, who were ahead of the others,
were heard giving glad yells. The secret of all
this joy was soon made manifest, for they had
really arrived at the junction of the Lewis with
the Columbia, as they immediately called the
majestic stream that, with a swift current, ran
to the west, and flowed out into the sea.</p>

<p>All their hopes, so long delayed, seemed now
on the eve of realization; and there were no despondent
hearts in the camp when night again
found them.</p>

<p>It was with satisfaction that they looked out
upon the noble stream, in the belief that the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
which President Jefferson had felt in
their ability to overcome all difficulties on the
road had now been justified.</p>

<p>It was just a day afterward that Roger found
a chance to strike his first salmon with the Indian
spear. He and Dick had gone ashore at a
likely-looking spot where a small tributary entered
the river. The character of the ground
emboldened Roger to believe he might run
across some of the places such as the Indians
loved to frequent when fishing after their peculiar
style.</p>

<p>He found that he could creep along and look
down upon the water five or six feet below,
where the shadows were dense, and the passage
of a silvery salmon would seem like a ray of
sunlight.</p>

<p>Here the boy waited, crouching silently, just
as he imagined the expert Indian fish-spearers
were wont to hang. And presently Dick, who
was watching close by, saw him make a furious
jab with his spear. Following this, Roger
struggled desperately, and then dragged up a
magnificent fish, floundering at the end of the
spear.</p>

<p>This he repeated twice more, when they had
enough for the whole party. That was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a red letter day in the life of Roger, and one he
was not likely soon to forget.</p>

<p>More days passed, and they were constantly
descending the majestic river, now unusually
high on account of the recent heavy rains.
Twice they were compelled to cut short their
day’s trip in order to seek shelter from a downpour;
and, after such a recent experience of the
dry and arid strip of country stretching out
toward the foot of the Rocky Mountains, they
hardly knew what to make of such weather.</p>

<p>There came a day when, ahead of them, they
heard a dull sound that thrilled every heart.
The falls of the Columbia must be at hand,
where they would be compelled to make a portage
with the canoes and their cargoes.</p>

<p>Roger would have liked to strike out and be
the first to get within seeing distance of this
natural wonder, but Dick curbed his impatience.</p>

<p>“Better hold back and keep near the rest,”
he advised. “We none of us know anything
about the falls, and from the Indians we’ve
heard they are very dangerous. They even
claim that a bad spirit is chained under the
water, and always ready to overturn the canoe
of any venturesome brave who ventures too
near.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>The current was becoming furiously swift,
and Captain Lewis, like the wise leader he was,
advised that all the boats make for the shore.
It required considerable sturdy work to effect
this, for they had already gone further down
than discretion fully warranted.</p>

<p>All would have gone well except for an unfortunate
accident. The paddle which Roger was
using had been cracked a little recently; indeed
he had just that morning discovered the flaw,
and declared he must lose no time in making a
new one.</p>

<p>When Roger worked he did it with all his vim
and energy; consequently there was a greater
strain on his paddle than would have been the
case had Dick, for instance, been handling it.</p>

<p>Feeling the savage pull of the fierce current
the boy even put a little extra strength into his
labor, which was a hazardous thing to do, considering
the circumstances.</p>

<p>Dick, methodically handling his own blade,
was suddenly thrilled to hear his comrade give
vent to a cry of dismay. As he looked up he
saw Roger holding the fragment of a paddle in
his hands. The treacherous blade had broken
just at the most critical time possible. They
were held fast in the grip of a current which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Dick, with his single paddle, could never succeed
in combatting; and just below them the roar of
the falls sounded, while they could see the foam-capped
waves, that announced the beginning of
the rapids, just ahead of their drifting canoe!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>NEARING THE SALTY SEA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fortunately</span> the others were close at hand
when this catastrophe happened. Dick, of
course, plied his paddle with the utmost vigor,
but, in spite of his endeavors, their canoe was
dragged perilously close to the verge of the fall,
and, if left to themselves, the boys would have
had a serious time of it.</p>

<p>The nearest boat chanced to contain Jasper
Williams and another. Williams had always
been known as a quick-witted man when trouble
came suddenly from a clear sky.</p>

<p>Loud cries arose. Then this boat was seen
speeding straight toward the one that had been
crippled by the breaking of the paddle.</p>

<p>“Here, take hold of this rope!” Jasper Williams
was heard calling, and Roger, who had
been watching the approach of the other canoe
in a sort of dumb anxiety, not knowing how their
arrival would help, managed to secure the line
that came flying through the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw what the trapper had in mind. Dick,
too, bent all his energies to his own paddle,
while the blades in the other canoe flashed fast
and furiously as the two paddlers bent their
broad backs to the task.</p>

<p>The current was loath to give up its expected
prey, and it fought furiously before admitting
defeat; but brain triumphed in the end. One
thing that helped materially was the fact that
with every yard they gained in the direction of
the bank the grip of the current grew less
severe.</p>

<p>In the end they reached land, much to the relief
of both boys. Roger looked a little white
under the eyes, although he stoutly protested
that he had not been much alarmed.</p>

<p>When later on they had a chance to see from
what they had escaped through the happy circumstance
of Jasper Williams’ possession of
the rope, the boys were very grateful things
had turned out as they did. Dick realized
that there was not much hope for any one
unfortunate enough to be swept over those falls,
and carried through the rapids, where cruel
rocks waited on every hand to bruise the victim.</p>

<p>The party went into camp on the spot, and
expected to be lulled to sleep that night by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
incessant roar as the water took the plunge.
Roger meant to busy himself below the falls as
soon as he could get there, armed with his spear,
of which he had by this time become very proud.</p>

<p>They soon learned that this spot was a favorite
fishing place for the Indians. Indeed, there
did not seem to be a minute of the day that one
or more dusky sons of the wilderness could not
be seen prowling around, armed with spears
with which they would adroitly stab any fish that
came within reach. (<a id="Note_9r"></a><a href="#Note_9">Note 9</a>.)</p>

<p>The salmon on reaching a waterfall exhibits
a wonderful agility in lofty leaping, in the endeavor
to gain the upper reaches of the stream.
This, of course, is more frequent in the spring
when the fish wish to reach their spawning beds
far up in the rivers. Still, the boys saw many
fish make the leap while they were at the falls,
some reaching projecting ledges, and resting for
another frantic attempt; others falling back,
doubtless to make a more successful effort later.</p>

<p>These Indians the boys found were of a different
tribe from any they had thus far encountered,
and they soon decided they must belong
to the fighting tribe of whom they had
heard so many contradictory accounts, the Flat
Heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Very naturally, since they had probably never
before seen a white man, the Indians displayed
considerable curiosity. They were at first inclined
to flee, showing all the signs of alarm and
enmity; but Captain Lewis made friendly signs,
and in the end succeeded in soothing their fears.</p>

<p>“I don’t like their looks, though,” Roger said
to Dick, as they watched several of the Flat
Head braves accepting little trinkets, such as
colored beads and minute mirrors, which had
been carried along for the purpose of trading
with the natives.</p>

<p>“I agree with you there,” admitted Dick.
“They have a different appearance from the
friendly Nez Perces, the Mandans, or any other
tribe we have met so far.”</p>

<p>“I believe they must be more treacherous than
the others,” continued Roger, uneasily. “You
know we have heard not a single good word
about them from any source.”</p>

<p>“Well, ‘the proof of the pudding is in the
eating of it,’ as we’ve heard many the time at
home, Roger; and we shouldn’t judge people
wholly by their looks. Captain Lewis seems
to be willing to trust them. If any person
can make friends with these Flat Heads, he
will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“Unless they’ve already determined to hate,
and try to exterminate us,” grumbled the other,
of course referring to the underhand measures
which they believed Lascelles and his companion
meant to put into practice.</p>

<p>It was not long before Roger found a good
use for his spear. He watched how the red fishermen
plied their weapons and copied their
method. Although he could hardly expect to
be an expert in the beginning the boy soon
learned to handle his new tool with considerable
skill; and Dick commended his work when he
saw him strike a splendid silvery fish that had
shown itself near the surface.</p>

<p>It was not a very difficult task getting the
canoes around the portage, or carry. There
was a regular path which doubtless had been
worn by the moccasined feet of countless red Indians
for ages past, since this spot must always
have been a favorite one for laying in stores of
fish food.</p>

<p>The second night was passed some distance
below the falls, though their musical roar could
still be plainly heard. Always eager to learn
facts in connection with what lay ahead, Captain
Lewis questioned some of the Indians once
more with regard to how many days journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
they still had to expect before arriving at the
ocean.</p>

<p>Thanks to his mastery of the sign language,
the commander was able to discover what he
sought; and it was pleasing intelligence that he
communicated to the rest of the company that
same night.</p>

<p>November was at hand, and before the month
had gone far they should arrive at the termination
of their great adventure, with the ocean
stretching before them.</p>

<p>From the present time they could count on an
easy voyage, unless something entirely unexpected
cropped up to dismay them. The current
of the Columbia was swift, and could be
counted on to carry them along without a paddle
being dipped, if they felt like avoiding the labor.</p>

<p>Already were the men beginning to count on
the glorious experience they expected to have
while the winter lasted, hunting and fishing as
the weather permitted, and with the wonderful
sea to gaze upon. It was planned to go into
winter quarters as soon as they arrived at their
destination. This would permit of their gathering
a great store of food, after the Indian
custom.</p>

<p>Only one fly remained in the ointment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
boys. They could not forget that, as long as
the revengeful Frenchman, François Lascelles,
hovered about that part of the country, they
could never feel safe. No matter if he were
unseen, they knew him well enough to believe
that he would be plotting in some underhand
way to injure them, as he had done so many
times in the past.</p>

<p>“We will never know a minute’s peace as
long as that man is alive,” said Roger, when
the subject came up to cast a shadow on their
happiness.</p>

<p>The weather did not improve as they descended
the Columbia. Rain fell frequently,
and twice they saw where serious landslides had
occurred. It made them more careful as to
where they camped when night came, for, should
they be so unfortunate as to be caught in one
of these slips, the result was apt to be exceedingly
serious.</p>

<p>They saw Indians daily. Sometimes these
were ashore, and again they met them in canoes
made of hide, or, it might be, dugouts formed
from logs. In most cases the natives avoided
them, for the sight of white faces and beards
filled them with wonder and fear. Some of
them must have believed the explorers had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
from one of the stars, and were people of another
world, for never had they dreamed there
could be any but copper-colored inhabitants on
this sphere.</p>

<p>Nor were the adventurers always free from
peril from this source. On several occasions an
arrow had been known to hurtle into camp; and
one of the men even received a flesh wound.</p>

<p>For a short time it was feared the shaft might
have had a poisoned tip, and every expedient to
neutralize the venom was immediately applied.
As the man did not suffer any great disability
on account of his injury, they finally concluded
that the Flat Heads, at least, did not dip the
heads of their war arrows in the poison of the
rattlesnake, as some tribes were known to do.
(<a id="Note_10r"></a><a href="#Note_10">Note 10</a>.)</p>

<p>Captain Lewis did not like the menacing manner
in which some of these Indians acted when
on the bank of the river, while the little flotilla
of canoes was passing.</p>

<p>“I feel certain there is some malign influence
at work, behind the scenes,” Dick heard him
telling Captain Clark, after they had seen a
manifestation of this ill humor one day, when
several half-naked red skins brandished their
spears toward them as the boats drifted past, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the same time uttering angry cries; “and, since
we happen to know that Lascelles slipped past
us down the river, there can be no doubt it is his
work.”</p>

<p>“A few days more and we shall be there, the
captain says,” announced Roger, as he made his
way back a short distance up the river in company
with his chum, they having noticed signs
of game.</p>

<p>The boys had gone about half a mile from the
camp, having caught sight of a feeding deer.</p>

<p>“We are getting close to the spot where we
glimpsed that deer feeding on the green grass,
so let us stop talking, and be on the watch,”
Dick suggested, thinking the animal might have
moved from its place.</p>

<p>Three minutes afterwards Roger gave a low
“hist.”</p>

<p>“I can see him right now,” he whispered, and,
following the direction of the extended finger,
Dick also caught sight of the dun-colored figure.</p>

<p>Really it must have been a very hungry deer.
As a rule such an animal, when feeding, is so
nervous and suspicious that every minute or so
its tail will whisk, and the hunters know from
this that the deer will immediately raise its head
to take a look around. But although the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
as they advanced kept their eyes fastened closely
on their intended quarry, they could not see even
the slightest movement.</p>

<p>Roger had begged the privilege of having first
shot, and, when they had crept as close as seemed
wise, his gun-stock came up against his cheek,
his eye ran along the sights, and then his finger
pressed the hair trigger of the long-barreled
rifle.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the deer never moved even
then. Roger was more than amazed.</p>

<p>“Give him a shot, Dick!” he cried, “or he
may get away from us yet, thanks to my poor
aim!”</p>

<p>Dick was about to comply, when suddenly the
deer toppled over. There was something decidedly
suspicious in the way the animal collapsed,
and Dick had a flash of intelligence
sweep over him. He believed the deer was being
used for a stalking animal, and had been dead
all the while, its body propped up to deceive
them. And even as this dreadful truth struck
him, he heard loud Indian whoops ring out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>A MOMENT OF PERIL</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">We</span> are done for!” cried Roger, as vociferous
yells from various quarters told of the sudden
peril that had burst upon them.</p>

<p>The pioneer boys had often, when sitting at
the knees of their fathers, heard how the crafty
Indians along the Ohio River, wishing to coax
the settlers ashore when they drifted down the
stream in their shanty boats, would resort to a
ruse.</p>

<p>There were white renegades among the natives,
men like Simon Girty, who had been
chased out of the settlements for wrong-doing,
and who, hating their kind, had joined fortunes
with the red tribes.</p>

<p>One of these turncoats would disguise himself,
and set up a plaintive appeal for help,
claiming to be an honest man, who had just escaped
from the torture post of the Indians, and
begging the newcomers not to forsake him.</p>

<p>In a few instances his appeals would touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the hearts of the whites, so that, even against
their good judgment, they were known to work
the flatboat near the bank. Of course an attack
always followed, the Indians springing up from
their places of concealment.</p>

<p>Dick remembered those thrilling stories now,
when he and Roger were victims of a ruse along
similar lines. That dummy deer had been
placed so it could be seen by those in the canoes.
The master mind capable of conceiving this
trick knew well that the two lads were born
hunters, and, in the need of fresh meat for the
camp, could hardly resist the temptation.</p>

<p>The game had worked only too well. So cleverly
had the dead deer been arranged that even
their sharp eyes had failed to detect anything
wrong, except that the animal seemed to remain
persistently in one spot, and never raised his
head.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, flitting forms were seen
among the trees. The boys did not stop to count
them, but there must certainly have been a full
dozen of the enemy.</p>

<p>Two figures they glimpsed that were not copper-colored,
and nearly destitute of clothing, as
was the case with the Flat Head braves. There
was no need to call out and announce their discovery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
for both boys realized in a flash that
they were once again face to face with the evil
genius of their lives, the French trader, François
Lascelles, together with his equally unscrupulous
ally, Andrew Waller.</p>

<p>Roger, with his customary impulsiveness, felt
a wave of hot indignation sweep over him. This
man, whom they had never sought to harm, had
followed them ever since they set out from their
homes on the lower Missouri, bent on saving the
Armstrong property. Many times had they
suffered from his persecution, and no one could
really blame Roger for feeling bitterly toward
the trader.</p>

<p>Influenced by his impulsive and headstrong
nature, he hastily threw his gun up to his shoulder,
and, covering the advancing Frenchman,
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>No report followed, which at the moment was
a bitter disappointment to Roger, with his mind
so set on settling the score then and there. Of
course, it flashed upon him that he could not
expect his gun to load itself, since he had just
fired the one bullet it contained into the deer
that had been used as a decoy.</p>

<p>With a cry of anger he turned, and, almost
before Dick knew what was up, had snatched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
loaded rifle from his hands, thrusting his own
useless weapon into his chum’s grasp.</p>

<p>But the two renegades saw him do this, and
realized their danger, for, though the exchange
took but a couple of seconds, they had had sufficient
warning to put stout trees between themselves
and the angry boy.</p>

<p>When Roger whirled around, bent on carrying
out his design, he was just in time to see
Waller vanish behind a tree. It was a foregone
conclusion that the quick-witted Lascelles had
been even faster in his movements, since he
knew well that he must be the object of the lad’s
blind anger.</p>

<p>Indians there were in sight, running toward
them, and brandishing their tomahawks and
spears threateningly, at the same time dodging
behind various trees as if to confuse the “palefaces.”</p>

<p>Evidently they feared those wonderful sticks
that spat out fire, and made a sound like unto
the near-by thunder, as well as mysteriously
slew whatever they were pointed at.</p>

<p>“We must run for it, Roger!” cried Dick, seeing
that it was folly to think of trying to stand
off a dozen savages with but one loaded gun
between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right!” gasped Roger, as he swung
around and put himself in motion, for it was
plain to be seen that not a second should be lost
if they hoped to outwit the enemy.</p>

<p>No sooner was their intention evident than a
new burst of wild yells told that the Indians
were in hot pursuit. High above the fiendish
cries Dick could hear the heavier voices of the
two treacherous white men, and he knew that
Lascelles and Waller must be keeping in the
van of their pursuers.</p>

<p>The boys might have turned and tried to
frighten the Indians off by a second shot, but
it would be losing precious time, and every second
must count when their lives hung in the balance.</p>

<p>The boys were clever runners, and under ordinary
conditions might have been able to keep
well ahead of the fleet-footed Indians. There
was one unfortunate thing, however, that promised
to hamper them sadly, and it concerned
Roger’s ability to keep up the pace.</p>

<p>Several days before, almost a week in fact, he
had turned his ankle, and had ever since complained
of feeling it pain him from time to time,
especially if he gave that foot any sort of a
wrench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not taken a score of leaps when his
toe chanced to catch in a root, and, while the
boy did not measure his length on the ground,
he did feel a sharp pain shoot through that weak
ankle.</p>

<p>It made his heart sink to realize that he was
bound to feel it worse with every bound he took,
and that in the end it might be the means of
their downfall.</p>

<p>Dick had kept close to the river-bank in his
flight. He did this for several good reasons.
In the first place, they had come that way, and
knew the ground more or less. Then, again,
the camp lay up the river, and, if help was to
meet them part way, they must head straight
for the boats.</p>

<p>He was inclined at first to try to shout, in the
expectation that those in camp would come to
their assistance the faster; but, on second
thought, he realized it would only be wasting
his breath. Surely they must have heard the
sound of Roger’s rifle, and those wild whoops
bursting on their ears soon afterwards would
tell their friends what had happened.</p>

<p>He fully believed Captain Clark would sally
forth with some of the men, bent on attempting
their rescue. It was only a question of keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
ahead of their persistent pursuers long enough
to allow the others to come up.</p>

<p>“Faster, Roger, faster!”</p>

<p>Roger heard his comrade say this and he
strove his utmost to obey, but the injured ankle
was giving him more trouble every second and,
despite his efforts, he failed to keep up to his
usual standard of speed.</p>

<p>“My ankle—I’ve hurt it again!” he called
out, between his set teeth.</p>

<p>Dick heard this with a thrill of horror. It
seemed to seal their fate, for, if they could not
increase their speed, the Indians were bound to
overtake them long before any help might arrive.</p>

<p>He tried to catch hold of Roger’s arm, as
though his first thought was to render assistance;
but that was impossible when running
as they were. Roger indeed shook himself
free.</p>

<p>“Save yourself, Dick! I’m nearly done for!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Dick did not try to answer. He needed all
his breath to carry him along; but, if he had
spoken, it would have been to scorn indignantly
the suggestion that he leave his chum behind,
and look out for himself. Dick was not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
kind of boy; and if need be he would stand by
Roger, fighting to the end.</p>

<p>There was the swift-running river just beside
them. Dick wished from the bottom of his
heart that they could in some way make use of
it in order to give their pursuers the slip; yet
he could not decide how it could be accomplished.</p>

<p>If they jumped in, and attempted to swim
across, there were undoubtedly among the half-naked
braves many who could make faster progress,
unhampered as they would be with clothes.
Oh! if only one of the boats would shoot into
view, manned by a couple of the brave fellows
whose guns would soon work havoc among the
natives and put them to flight!</p>

<p>Dick saw no chance of obtaining help from
that quarter. The ground underfoot was now
slippery, and he remembered that they had
passed over a place where the earth seemed
spongy.</p>

<p>He could only see one hope left. This was for
them to seek refuge behind trees, and try to hold
the enemy at bay long enough to enable their
friends to arrive on the spot. And, since the
Indians might rush them despite their threatening
guns, this seemed almost like a forlorn hope.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<small>THE END OF THE LONG TRAIL</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was just at that critical moment that something
wholly unexpected happened. As long as
they lived Dick and Roger believed that the
Providence that had so long watched over their
fortunes, seeing their terrible distress, had come
to the rescue.</p>

<p>They heard a sudden sound that bewildered
them at first. It was a horrible sucking noise,
and both lads actually felt the ground quivering
under their feet.</p>

<p>Instinctively they came to a pause, as the
yells back of them changed to cries of great
fear, some of which seemed to be half-muffled.
There was, accompanying these sounds, a
strange splashing, and the crash of trees going
down.</p>

<p>As the boys whirled around, stunned by all
these remarkable sounds, they looked upon one
of the most terrifying spectacles that had ever
come before them. A large section of the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of the river, where they had found it so wet in
passing, had suddenly let go while the Indians
were crossing it, and, together with a number
of trees, had slipped into the deep river. Fully
half of the Flat Head Indians went with the
landslide, together with both of the renegades.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i337.jpg" width="312" height="500" alt="boys watching Indians falling in landslide" />
<div class="caption">“FULLY HALF OF THE FLAT HEAD INDIANS WENT WITH THE LANDSLIDE”</div>
</div>

<p>Dick plainly discovered Lascelles throwing up
his arms in an agony of fear, as he found himself
being dragged along, with those tons and
tons of earth, into a watery grave. Then a
great tree smashed down directly over him and
that was the last that human eyes ever saw of
the French trader.</p>

<p>The rest of the Indians stood there spellbound,
just as the two boys did. Superstitious
to the core, those who were left must have believed
this calamity could only be looked on as
a manifestation of anger on the part of the
Great Manitou, who doubtless held the strange
boys, with the white skins, under his protection.</p>

<p>They made not the slightest attempt to rescue
their unfortunate comrades, but, uttering cries
of terror, vanished in the depths of the forest,
doubtless carrying to their village a terrible
story of what had occurred, to cause weeping
and wailing among the lodges of the Flat Heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Still watching, the boys saw several figures
climb up out of the agitated waters. They were
in every instance the copper-colored natives,
who went limping away, looking back in abject
terror.</p>

<p>Though they watched closely, the boys could
discover not the slightest trace of either of the
renegades. The trees floated off, or remained
there sunk in the water; but a close examination
of the scene of the landslide convinced Dick
and Roger they had surely seen the last of their
bitter enemies.</p>

<p>The two boys could not express their emotion
except by clasping each other’s hands and
squeezing them fiercely. Their safety had been
brought about through no mortal agency; and
it was not singular that they always looked upon
the landslide as a miracle wrought in their interest.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, when Dick had taken his
own gun, and Roger managed to get a load in
his weapon, they heard the sound of voices, and
some of the men from the camp appeared. Just
as the boys had anticipated, they were led by
brave Captain Clark.</p>

<p>Great was their amazement when they heard
the wonderful story the lads had to tell. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
seemed almost unbelievable, and yet there was
the evidence before their very eyes, the gap in
the river bank, the fallen trees, and even some
of the Indian tomahawks on the ground where
they had been cast when the remainder of the
band fled in dismay from the fatal spot.</p>

<p>When Captain Lewis was told about it, he
declared it to be the judgment of Heaven upon
the heads of those two wicked men. They had
sought to stir up the resentment of the Flat
Heads against the little party, and, had their
plans succeeded, the members of the expedition
would be in constant danger of their lives during
the whole of the coming winter.</p>

<p>As it was, the Indians must believe the white
wanderers were under the protection of Manitou,
and should not be harmed. Captain Lewis
could see how a peace could be made with their
leading chiefs, so that, for the months that were
to come, the red men and their “paleface”
brothers should live together as friends.</p>

<p>After all their trials and tribulations things
seemed to be working in the boys’ favor at last.
With the disappearance of the scheming trader
their greatest source of uneasiness had vanished.
The future looked bright once more, and
the boys felt they could sleep without fearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
that something terrible hung over their heads.</p>

<p>That night was really the happiest they had
all known for many months. The fact that they
were close to the goal that had tempted them
across the continent did much to bring smiles
to the careworn faces of the voyagers.</p>

<p>“If all the accounts we’ve been able to pick
up are correct,” Dick told Roger that night,
while they sat near the fire, the camp being well
guarded every minute of the time, “we ought
to reach our destination by the end of the second
day, perhaps sooner.”</p>

<p>“Which means we will be able to look out into
the west and see nothing but the vast ocean,”
Roger added, with a contented sigh. “Well, I
feel glad—yes, doubly glad, for Captain Lewis
and Captain Clark.”</p>

<p>“I understand why you say that, Roger. To
us it means only that our curiosity will be satisfied;
but think what they have risked to carry
out the plan of the President! It will be the
greatest day in their lives when they reach that
ocean they have come thousands of miles to
look upon.”</p>

<p>“And think of all they have braved to win
their end,” added the other boy, his whole expression
speaking his deepest admiration for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
the bold leaders of the exploring expedition.</p>

<p>Well might the boys say what they did. A
thousand perils had waylaid those daring spirits,
yet never once had they dreamed of giving
up their plan. Over unknown trails, through
dark canyons, across trackless plains and burning
deserts, up mighty rivers with their strong
currents and swirling rapids—all these and uncounted
other dangers had spread out before
them, but without daunting their souls.</p>

<p>No wonder then that the boy of to-day, who
reads of this most wonderful journey ever undertaken
in our great country, reveres the names
of those two bold spirits who conducted the expedition
to a successful finish.</p>

<p>With the coming of another day the journey
was resumed. Even the weather seemed to
have undergone a fit of repentance, for the skies
were now as clear as crystal, and the rainy spell
had evidently passed.</p>

<p>Early in the morning several of the men hastened
to the place where the boys had been deceived
by the decoy deer. They brought back
the game, since none of the thoroughly alarmed
Flat Heads had dared return for the carcass.</p>

<p>It was easily seen just how cleverly the animal’s
head had been fixed by means of stout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
sticks and deerskin thongs. The men also
judged that it had been made to stand erect by
the aid of other sticks skillfully concealed. On
the whole, the boys concluded they had a story
to relate that would arouse the greatest interest
among the home folks, if ever they were fortunate
enough to rejoin the family circle again.</p>

<p>Roger was glad that the remainder of the
journey was to be made in the canoes, for his
ankle pained him exceedingly, and he would
have been unable to walk any distance without
feeling much distress.</p>

<p>“You will have to take things easy for a
while, after we get to our journey’s end,” Dick
told him. “A sprained ankle is a bad job, and
you may feel it for many weeks. I can look
back and remember how long it took me to get
over a wrenched ankle some years ago.”</p>

<p>At that Roger laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“I haven’t forgotten that time, either, let me
tell you, Dick. We were off on a hunt when
you tripped. How your ankle did swell up; it
frightened me, I tell you! But that cold spring
water helped a lot to take the swelling down.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I can see you now, staggering along
with me on your back,” continued Dick, bending
a look of sincere affection upon his cousin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
“That was the heaviest load you ever undertook
to tote, I wager.”</p>

<p>“But I got there, didn’t I?” demanded the
other, proudly, “winded though I was. And I
made you a pretty fine crutch which you hobbled
around on for weeks, not being able to put
your foot on the ground.”</p>

<p>Many times, as they talked, did these fond
memories of the past arise to haunt them. The
further they went from their well-loved homes
the sharper the pictures seemed to become in
their minds. Their dreams were mostly of
those dear ones whose faces were forever before
them, in the clear waters, while threading the
mazes of the forest, or even looking out upon
the glittering sands of the burning desert.</p>

<p>When, that afternoon, a halt was made, Captain
Lewis cheered them with the announcement
that there could be little doubt they would reach
the mouth of the big river by the following night
at the latest. Indeed, as the men had already
discovered that the water was strongly impregnated
with salt, they hardly needed this assurance
to convince them that their long journey
was on the eve of termination.</p>

<p>They gave the commander a hearty cheer,
however, when he told them this welcome fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
then set about making what was certainly one
of the happiest camps of the entire trip.</p>

<p>As usual the two boys talked things over while
they sat resting after supper had been dispatched.
Roger had sniffed the air several
times, and he finally broke out with a declaration.</p>

<p>“There seems to be something queer in the
air, Dick; something I’ve never before noticed
in all my life. And to tell you the truth, I can
make nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“I may be wrong,” Dick told him; “but, from
all I’ve heard grandfather say, I think that must
be the salty taste they say one can notice when
the air comes straight off the sea. If that is
so, it proves we are close to the mouth of the
river right now.”</p>

<p>After that Roger amused himself by sniffing
the air many times. It seemed to give him
fresh encouragement to have a silent but powerful
proof carried by the night breeze to their
river camp.</p>

<p>Taken in all, it was a rather restless night
for some of the adventurers, and the boys in
particular awoke many times, to sit up and listen.
Once Dick even fancied he could hear a
far-off, dull, booming sound that could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
be thunder, since the stars were out, and not a
cloud as big as his hand in sight.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” the boy said softly to himself,
with a feeling almost of awe, “if that can be
the sea pounding on the shore. Grandfather
has often told us how it makes a great noise
when the tide is coming in, each wave running
along and turning over as it breaks on the
sand.”</p>

<p>He even sat there for a long while listening,
though thinking it best not to arouse Roger, who
chanced to be sleeping at the time. Only when
the strange sound died out, owing to a change
of wind, or the turn of the tide, Dick consented
once more to drop back in his blanket. But,
when he did get to sleep again, his dreams were
of the glorious triumph that awaited them close
at hand.</p>

<p>The last day dawned, and the camp was early
astir. Breakfast was hastily eaten, the small
amount of boat packing attended to, and after
that a start was made.</p>

<p>To-day the paddles were seldom idle.
Spurred on by the hope of reaching their goal
before darkness again intervened, the men were
only too willing to work their passage. The
swift current might be very well under ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
conditions, but on this particular day it proved
all too slow for their eager hearts.</p>

<p>They glimpsed Indians several times, but,
strange to say, none of them manifested the antagonistic
manner of those they had seen earlier
in their trip down the Lewis and the Columbia
rivers.</p>

<p>Roger, who had noticed the change in the demeanor
of the natives, wondered what was the
cause of it, and as usual applied to Dick for his
opinion.</p>

<p>“They are of the same tribe,” he remarked,
“for by now I know the Flat Head way of wearing
feathers in their scalp-locks. But they
seem now to be afraid of us, for those in that
dugout paddled frantically for the shore; and
never an arrow comes our way now. Can you
make it out, Dick?”</p>

<p>“The only thing I can think of,” Dick replied,
“is that word has been sent out everywhere
that the ‘paleface people’ in the hide canoes are
under the protection of Manitou, and that no
harm must be done to them.”</p>

<p>“Well,” observed Roger, with a happy smile,
“if we’re going to be guarded by the Indian
Manitou all winter, we needn’t be afraid of anything.
When you come to think of it, Dick, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
landslide was the greatest thing that ever happened
to us. It held back just long enough to
let us pass, and then swallowed our enemies up.”</p>

<p>Noon came and went.</p>

<p>The men were so eager now they hardly
wished to land to have something to eat, though
Captain Lewis insisted on it, for he knew they
needed a rest.</p>

<p>Slowly the long afternoon passed, and, constantly
on the move, the canoes swept along the
current, urged by the muscles that seemed never
to tire. Hope fought with a growing disappointment.
Were they then, after all, to be
cheated out of the anticipated triumph they had
arranged for that night? Perish the thought!
and, with that, the paddlers would dip deeper,
and run a race to see which could hold the van.</p>

<p>The sun sank lower and lower, and every eye
watched its race with almost the same anxiety
as was shown when, centuries back, Joshua commanded
the heavenly luminary to stand still in
order that his army might wholly destroy the
Philistines.</p>

<p>Dick and Roger concluded that, unless something
happened inside of another hour, they
would have to give up all hope of seeing the
glad sight that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“We are about to turn a bend in the bank
right below,” Dick told Roger, “and, if all is
well, perhaps we may see what we are yearning
to look upon.”</p>

<p>All possible speed was made in order to turn
the point of land covered with trees, that jutted
out into the river. Then from every throat
arose a joyous shout that made the echoes ring.
It was the very first white man’s hurrah that
was ever heard on the western side of the great
American continent, north of the isthmus, since
time began.</p>

<p>There lay the mouth of the Columbia River,
and, looking beyond, they could see the boundless
expanse of the Pacific, with the sun, that had
beckoned them on all these thousands of miles,
setting in a red blaze of glory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<small>TO THE RISING SUN—CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following day the flag of the United
States floated from the green hills of Columbia
Bay. And, when the adventurers had become
thoroughly rested, they began to discuss the
matter as to where they would stay during the
coming winter.</p>

<p>Just what sort of severe weather they might
expect none of them, of course, knew. In those
early days nothing was understood with reference
to the famous warm Japan ocean current,
which does for the Pacific coast what the Gulf
Stream accomplishes for much of our eastern
shore, as well as for Europe.</p>

<p>So cabins were finally built, in which they
hoped to keep fairly comfortable, and by degrees
a supply of meat was laid, in for consumption
during the winter, if the cold should be prolonged
like a Canadian season.</p>

<p>They soon found that the Indians meant to be
friendly, and all fear of trouble from this source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
was laid to rest. As the days and weeks crept
on they explored some of the surrounding country,
and even tried to make rude maps of it to
show when they returned East.</p>

<p>Dick and Roger did their full share in everything
that went on. Much of the meat that was
dried that winter, in order to provide a supply
on the return trip over the mountains and down
the Missouri, fell before their guns.</p>

<p>They were also instrumental in helping to tan
some of the skins to be used in making necessary
clothing for the men. Having been almost
two years on the trail, some of the members of
the expedition were sadly in need of garments;
and this well-tanned buckskin supplied the deficiency
admirably, for in those pioneer days
every man was his own tailor.</p>

<p>It would hardly be fitting here to try to tell
the many things that occupied their attention as
the winter months passed; but they were busy
most of the time. To the surprise of all the
weather never became severe. Snow they saw
on the sides of the mountains, but, taken in all,
they suffered very little from cold, a fact that astonished
them very much.</p>

<p>Finally the spring came, and all eyes were
eagerly turned toward the rising sun; for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
known that the time was now near at hand when
they must start upon the return trip.</p>

<p>The ties that drew them all, men and boys, to
the East were many and strong. Their hearts
often swelled with emotion as they thought of
those from whom they had been separated so
many months.</p>

<p>“Why,” Roger was accustomed to saying,
when he and his chum discussed the time of their
departure, now close at hand, “I feel sure I will
never know my little sister, Mary, when I see
her again; she must be such a big girl by now.
And as for your brother, Sam, you may find him
able to give you a good tussle in a wrestle.”</p>

<p>Thus they often talked of their loved ones, but
neither of the boys ever dared express the one
dread fear that sometimes tugged at their heartstrings,
which was that they might find some
face missing in the family circle when they
reached home again.</p>

<p>Toward the end of March, everything being
favorable, they once more started up the broad
Columbia, saying farewell to the place where
they had passed such a contented winter. No
serious illness had visited them, and all were
very anxious to get started.</p>

<p>Reaching the village of the Nez Perces, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
had no difficulty in claiming their horses, which
had survived the winter. And, having made
many presents to their red friends, the adventurers
again set forth.</p>

<p>They had a faithful guide this time who
showed them how to avoid some of the worst of
the burning desert. The changed season of the
year also aided them, so that, in the end, they
reached in safety the lofty barrier that divided
the continent.</p>

<p>Crossing the Rocky Mountains they proceeded
to where they had left their companions,
and were fortunate enough to find them safe and
sound. It was a joyous reunion all around.</p>

<p>They had troubles with the Indians, though as
a rule they found the red men inclined to be
friendly; and, in return for medicine and services
rendered, received many favors at the hands
of the natives, including much-needed meat.</p>

<p>Once, among the Blackfeet, they were forced
to make a hasty flight, when some of the thievish
Indians tried to steal their horses; and in the
mêlée a brave was shot, though the animals were
saved.</p>

<p>When finally the Missouri was reached the
party set to work to make new canoes, having by
degrees lost their horses or traded them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the Indians for necessities. Captain Lewis
knew that for the hundreds of miles they now
had to traverse, boats would be far more preferable
to horses, because the going was all downstream,
with a swift current, the river being in
its spring flood.</p>

<p>Some of the canoes they made themselves,
others were purchased from the Indians; in
this way enough were provided to carry the entire
party.</p>

<p>Day after day they kept pushing resolutely
down the great river, camping by night on the
bank. The summer was already well along, and
they knew it would be close to October before
they could expect to make the village of St.
Louis, the first settlement on their course.</p>

<p>It was just about the end of September when
they did arrive, and the event created the most
intense excitement ever known in that border
post. Most people, who had seen the expedition
set forth nearly two and a half years back, believed
the brave captains and all with them had
perished.</p>

<p>When Mayhew, the scout, had shown up, bearing
the precious paper which meant so much to
the Armstrongs, he had, of course, brought
news; and it was known that the expedition had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
reached a place near the far distant headwaters
of the Missouri; but since then weary months of
waiting had ensued, with never a word, and
hope beat but faintly in those fond hearts at
home.</p>

<p>It was a joyous meeting. Roger could hardly
believe the tall girl who threw her arms about
his neck was his little sister, Mary; and as for
Sam, he bade fair to soon look down on Dick, he
was growing so fast.</p>

<p>Grandfather and Grandmother Armstrong
were both there, hale and hearty, and mighty
proud of their two sturdy grandsons, who had
made that wonderful trip to the western sea in
company with the President’s private secretary.</p>

<p>The whole country applauded the hardy men
who had done this great feat, and with reason,
for, as one account says:</p>

<p>“They were world conquerors in the best
sense, in that they had blazed the way for thousands
of sturdy homeseekers who soon followed
in their wake, building homes, cities, manufacturing
plants, railroads and telegraph lines
where once had roamed the lordly bison, the
herds of dun-colored antelope, the vast bodies of
stately elk; and where, in the silence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
mountains and the forest the grizzly bear—monarch
of the plains and the valleys—had moved
in the peace and seclusion of the vast wilderness.”</p>

<p>In later years, after the original pioneers of
the Armstrong family had been gathered to
their fathers, the families scattered, as new
things arose to lure some of the younger members
further into the wide West.</p>

<p>They have settled, the newer generations of
them, some in Oregon, along the mighty Columbia
which Dick and Roger were among the first
whites to see; others on wheat growing farms in
Dakota, or else on cattle ranches in Montana;
though there can still be found Armstrongs in
St. Louis, proud to trace their ancestry back to
those bold pioneers whose early history we have
attempted to narrate in these volumes.</p>

<p>Jasper Williams often visited his young
friends when he came to the growing settlement
at the junction of the Missouri with the Mississippi.
He lived to dandle the children of Dick
and Roger on his knee, and tell them many of
the exciting adventures which those two hold
lads encountered when crossing the Great Divide
with Lewis and Clark.</p>

<p>Nothing was ever heard of either Lascelles or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Andrew Waller, and the boys never entertained
a doubt but that the renegades met their fate in
that strange landslide by which they had been
precipitated into the Columbia.</p>

<p>And, since we have seen the safe return of the
wanderers, and watched the happy ending of
their great adventure, it is but right that we
bring our story of early pioneer days to a close.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_1"></a><a href="#Note_1r">Note 1</a> (<a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>)</span></h3>

<p>When the vast territory then known as Louisiana
was purchased from the French Nation for fifteen million
dollars, in the nineteenth century, no one knew
what its extent was. It took in the country west of
the Mississippi, from the Gulf below New Orleans;
but what really lay to the far northwest was merely a
conjecture.</p>

<p>President Jefferson was determined to know just
what was included in this Louisiana Purchase, and it
was mainly through his individual efforts that an expedition
was organized with the purpose of exploring
the country as far as the Pacific; for, of course, it was
understood that the ocean bounded the land on the
west.</p>

<p>His private secretary, Meriwether Lewis, was put
in command of the party, with a military second, Captain
Clark. What wonderful things they accomplished
history has recorded. It was in the spring of
1804 that the expedition left St. Louis, and two years
and a half expired before they returned to that border
post, having successfully carried out their undertaking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_2"></a><a href="#Note_2r">Note 2</a> (<a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>)</span></h3>

<p>In those early pioneer days flint and steel were commonly
brought into service when a fire was needed.
So expert did the settlers and borderers become in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
use of these that they thought little more of accomplishing
the end they had in view than a Boy Scout of
to-day does with the match. All they asked was a
handful of dry tinder, and the ready spark quickly
had a blaze going.</p>

<p>It was not so easy when the question of firing their
guns was concerned. The flint was fastened to the
heavy hammer, and, in falling, was supposed to strike
the steel plate provided for this purpose, when a spark
might be looked for. This, falling into the powder
placed in the little cavity known as the “pan,” brought
about the explosion. But, frequently, this small
amount of powder would be jostled from its receptacle,
and this would cause a failure at perhaps a most
critical time. Many a settler in those days lost his life
by just this accident; and frequent disappointments
during a hunt for game could be traced to the same
cause.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_3"></a><a href="#Note_3r">Note 3</a> (<a href="#Page_44">page 44</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Contact with the natives made the early settlers quite
proficient in deciphering Indian picture writing, so
they were able to read fairly well many communications
passing between parties of those who possibly
might be reckoned their deadly enemies. This method
of using crude designs to convey the sense of a communication,
or even the history of a tribe or family,
was often carried out by fanciful pictures decorating
the skin of which the teepee was made. In such fashion
many of the gallant deeds of the chief or warrior
to whom the wigwam belonged were perpetuated.</p>

<p>Really, little common sense alone is needed to decipher
most of these picture writings. Once the key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
had been found, they become as plain as print. Smoke
stands for fires; the sun is easily seen on the horizon,
or high above it, though toward the west, it may be;
horses; deer with antlers; men walking, running, or
crawling; and similar designs become plainly decipherable;
and in this manner the story that is intended
to be conveyed can be traced out.</p>

<p>It is an interesting study, and many who belong to
Boy Scout troops have found considerable entertainment
in pursuing the fascinating work.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_4"></a><a href="#Note_4r">Note 4</a> (<a href="#Page_50">page 50</a>)</span></h3>

<p>Among all the Indian tribes found upon the North
American Continent when the pioneers surged toward
the setting sun, none has interested the historian so
much as the Mandans, sometimes called the “White Indians,”
because their skins differed so much from
that of other tribes. All sorts of wild theories have
been offered as an explanation of the wide difference
existing between this tribe and others. It is true that
they buried their dead as did the rest of the tribes west
of the Mississippi, using scaffolds that the wolves
might not get to the bodies; and there were many other
habits that stamped them true Indians. At the same
time historians, who had lived among them, find a
similarity in many of their words and customs to the
Welsh people; and it has always been believed by many
that, long ago, a boat containing Welsh sailors was
wrecked in the Gulf of Mexico after a tropical hurricane,
and that, ascending the mighty river, the whites
married into some Indian tribe, so that eventually the
Mandans came into existence.</p>

<p>There have been other speculations, and it is very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to read about these various theories, and try
to guess which one of them can be the true explanation;
for that there must have been something remarkable
about the origin of this tribe no one can deny.
They were not as warlike as some of the tribes with
whom they came in contact, such as the fierce Sioux;
but at the same time it appears that they held their
own in the numerous wars which followed an invasion
by one tribe upon the hunting grounds of another.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Mandans were utterly wiped out
in later years by the great scourge of smallpox, which
possibly may have been one of the unwelcome gifts
brought to them by the palefaces.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_5"></a><a href="#Note_5r">Note 5</a> (<a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>)</span></h3>

<p>In crossing the great plains that lie between the
valley of the Mississippi and the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains, it is in these days difficult to realize the
tremendous changes that have taken place there during
the last fifty or sixty years. Especially is this true
with regard to animal life. Where to-day herds of
long-horned cattle graze, or vast fields of nodding
grain tell of the prosperous farmer, in those times uncounted
numbers of great shaggy bison roamed.</p>

<p>According to many of the accounts that have come
down to us from authentic sources, the sight of such
a herd rolling past, as far as the eye could see, and
for hour after hour, must have been a most impressive
spectacle.</p>

<p>Where have they all gone? Up to then the needs of
the Indians and the depredations of wild animals had
made no impression on the incredible number of the
herds; although the red men often drove hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the big animals over some precipice, and took nothing
but the tongues, to be dried as a delicacy.</p>

<p>The first serious inroad among the buffaloes occurred
when the railroad was being pushed across the plains,
and men like Cody, afterwards known as Buffalo Bill,
were employed to slaughter the beasts in order to provide
sufficient food for the thousands of workers.
Then it began to be the thing for parties to set out and
kill for the sake of the slaughter. The robes were also
brought into use for sleighing and other purposes.
But the advent of the repeating rifle signed the real
death warrant for the bison of the plains. Then
they rapidly dwindled to almost nothing. In place of
the millions that once galloped north and south in the
seasons there are to-day but one or two small herds, in
the National Yellowstone Park or in private preserves.
Like the once numerous wild pigeons called the passenger
pigeons which existed in untold numbers, the buffaloes
have had their day.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_6"></a><a href="#Note_6r">Note 6</a> (<a href="#Page_194">page 194</a>)</span></h3>

<p>In the cabin of every pioneer family could always be
seen rows of dried herbs fastened to the rafters. These
as a rule were intended for medicinal purposes, most
of them being brewed into tea, when sickness invaded
the household, which was not often, since the active
outdoor life, and the primitive food of the early settlers,
made them an exceedingly hardy race.</p>

<p>Most housewives knew how to make ointments for
sprains and healing by a clever admixture of these
strong decoctions with bear’s fat, or, if they chanced
to have it, pork lard, though in most cases pigs were
unknown to frontier life, while a bear was always a
possibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of those old remedies were fully as satisfactory
as those of the modern druggist. They were pure,
to begin with, and calculated not to serve as “cure-alls,”
but each intended for a specific purpose. Indeed,
it would seem as if in those days they counted on
Nature’s taking hold and lending a helping hand. A
simple remedy to break a fever was resorted to, and
then careful nursing, as well as a good constitution,
did the rest.</p>

<p>Before the Armstrong boys set out upon their trip
it was only natural for their mothers to see that in
their ditty bags they carried a supply of several of
these standard remedies.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_7"></a><a href="#Note_7r">Note 7</a> (<a href="#Page_233">page 233</a>)</span></h3>

<p>From the accounts that have been handed down to
us, written by Captain Lewis himself, it appears that
the explorers were awed and inspired by the wonderful
scenery that lay before them on their way to the
Great Divide. Rugged mountains were there, brown,
steep, hemlock-clad. Deep game trails led through
the tangled meshes of the forest, and in the sparkling
rivulets the trout jumped at the floating gnats and
other insects. Gorges and canyons had to be passed,
where the howling waters raced in an apparent agony,
and flute-like came the sound of the snow-cold water
against the pebbly bottoms.</p>

<p>At night the scream of the mountain lion echoed
across the silent valleys, while the bleat of the antelope
could be heard upon the vast plains near the river-bed.
Eagles soared above, peering disdainfully at the black
specks of men beneath; and sage hens craned their
necks at them, when they tramped from the river in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
search of game. Over all was the clear, pure air of
that vast mountain plateau, which invigorates, stimulates,
and makes one feel as if he had the strength of
ten. Inspired and stimulated by the thought that they
were making history, it is no wonder those men pressed
steadily on, determined to view the gray waters of the
fog-sheeted Pacific in the end.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_8"></a><a href="#Note_8r">Note 8</a> (<a href="#Page_268">page 268</a>)</span></h3>

<p>One of the first things noticed by the members of
the expedition, when they began to encounter the
tribes living near the Rockies, was the fact that every
warrior or chief who was looked up to as a brave man
wore a necklace of terrible bears’ claws. This proved
that the possessor had by his own individual prowess,
and usually in an encounter at close quarters, succeeded
in slaying one of those monster denizens of the
wilds, afterwards known as grizzly bears.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that this beast is by all odds
the most savage and dreaded wild animal of the
Western World. Indeed, there are those who say they
would much rather meet a lion or a tiger in its native
country than the grizzly bear. When an Indian, with
his primitive weapons, and at the risk of his life, was
able to take those claws, and string them about his
neck, none could dispute his right to the title of a
valiant man.</p>

<p>Those who have hunted big game under every sun
are frank enough to say that if a grizzly bear could
climb a tree like a panther, and get over ground as
fast as a lion, he would stand without a peer as the
most feared game to be found. In these modern days
of the repeating rifle of large bore, and the exploding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
bullet, it is not very difficult to kill the monster; but
every one who has seen a grizzly bear in his native
haunts is willing to hold in honor those red hunters of
the early times, who, armed only with hatchet and
knife, deliberately sought an encounter, bent on proving
their right to the name of warrior.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_9"></a><a href="#Note_9r">Note 9</a> (<a href="#Page_300">page 300</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The Indians took toll of the big silver-sided salmon
as they made their way up the Columbia to spawn.
They used as a rule a primitive fish spear with which
they were very expert.</p>

<p>There were always salmon to be found at the foot of
the fall, or in shallow creeks that emptied into the big
river, but, when the spring finally came, the fish would
pass in from the sea in multitudes beyond reckoning,
all eager to get up to the shallow waters where they
could spawn.</p>

<p>Eye witnesses of undoubted veracity have described
the scene where, in places, the multitude of these big
fish was so great that they filled the stream with a solid
mass.</p>

<p>Of course those days are past. In these times, when
numerous canneries are operating along the river, and
millions of tins of fish are put up every season, it could
hardly be expected that the supply would continue in
unlimited quantities. Though as yet there has been
no serious inroad made, thanks to the action of the
Federal Government, and the work of the active Fish
Commissioners, who see to it that the fish wheels, by
means of which catches are made, are regulated according
to law. Still the sight of the untold numbers that
greeted the eyes of the explorers on that early spring
of 1806 has passed forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Note_10"></a><a href="#Note_10r">Note 10</a> (<a href="#Page_305">page 305</a>)</span></h3>

<p>The fear sometimes felt by the explorers that the Indians
were using poisoned arrows was not unfounded,
since it was well known that some of the tribes resorted
to this fiendish practice, with the flint-tipped weapons
intended for war purposes.</p>

<p>Their usual way of making the arrows deadly was to
find a healthy looking rattlesnake, and provoke him by
thrusts from a long stick. When the reptile had become
sufficiently furious, and was lunging madly, a
piece of raw meat would be fastened to the end of the
pole, and this he was coaxed to strike again and again,
until it was well saturated with the green virus from
his fangs.</p>

<p>When this infected meat had become a mass of
poison, arrows were dipped in it, and allowed to dry.
Once these entered the flesh of an enemy, as a rule his
death was certain. Of course an entirely different
lot of arrows would be used for hunting purposes, the
deadly sort being kept only for war.</p>

<p>History however does not record many deaths from
this source, so it must be taken for granted that, as a
rule, the Indians disliked resorting to such a severe
measure of defense. Possibly it did not appeal to
them as exactly fair, and they were more than ready to
measure their tomahawks and knives and spears, as
well as their ordinary arrows, against the guns owned
by the white men. Certainly no one of the Lewis and
Clark party suffered from poisoned arrows during the
long journey across the western country.</p>
